abstract:
- content: General guidelines toward the preparations of a functional specification
    of transmission fixed-series capacitor (FSC) banks using overvoltage protection
    based on three technologies are provided. The three technologies are:- metal oxide
    varistors-metal oxide varistors with a forced-triggered bypass gaps, and thyristor
    protected series capacitors- thyristor protected series capacitor. This guide
    does not apply comprehensively to thyristor-controlled series capacitors.
