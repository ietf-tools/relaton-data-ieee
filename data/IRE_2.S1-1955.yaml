abstract:
- content: A set of definitions of basic waveguide terms prepared by the Technical
    Committee on Antennas and Waveguides was published as IRE Standards in December,
    1953 (53 IRE 2. Si). The present Standards on Waveguide Components, Definitions
    of Terms, represent an extension of the work of this committee from 1953 to 1955.
    Waveguide component terms have not previously been standardized by the IRE; however,
    with continuing development in this field the need for such definitions has become
    increasingly apparent. The present list comprises only the more general, basic
    and established terms. For example, Waveguide Transformer is defined but the many
    specific types of waveguide transformer such as Double Stub Transformer, Quarter-Wave
    Sleeve Transformer, Probe Transformer, Eccentric Line Transformer, and others
    are not defined. As used in the following definitions, Waveguide is a generic
    term which includes transmission line and uniconductor wave guides as special
    cases. For specific definitions see 53 IRE 2. 51.
