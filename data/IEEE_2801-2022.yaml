abstract:
- content: Promoted in this recommended practice are quality management activities
    for datasets used for artificial intelligence medical devices (AIMD). The document
    highlights quality objectives for organizations responsible for datasets. The
    document describes control of records during the lifecycle of datasets, including
    but not limited to data collection, annotation, transfer, utilization, storage,
    maintenance, updates, retirement, and other activities. The document emphasizes
    special consideration for the dataset quality management system, including but
    not limited to responsibility management, resource management, dataset realization,
    and quality control.
