abstract:
- content: This standard defines the preferred ratings for low-voltage ac (635V and
    below) power circuit breakers, general purpose dc (325V and below) power circuit
    breakers, heavy duty low voltage dc (3200V and below) power circuit breakers,
    and fused (integrally or non-integrally) low voltage ac (600V and below) power
    circuit breakers.
