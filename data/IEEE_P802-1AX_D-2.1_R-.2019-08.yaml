abstract:
- content: Link Aggregation allows parallel point-to-point links to be used as if
    they were a single link and also supports the use of multiple links as a resilient
    load-sharing interconnect between multiple nodes in two separately administered
    networks. This standard defines a MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability
    and provides general information relevant to specific MAC types.
