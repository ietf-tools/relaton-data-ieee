abstract:
- content: General guidelines for commissioning high-voltage direct-current (HVDC)
    converter stations and associated transmission systems are provided. These guidelines
    apply to HVDC systems utilizing 6-pulse or 12-pulse thyristor-valve converter
    units operated as a two-terminal HVDC transmission system or an HVDC back-to-back
    system.
