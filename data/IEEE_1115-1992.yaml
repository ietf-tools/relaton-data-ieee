abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1115-2000. Methods for defining the dc load and for sizing
    a nickel-cadmium battery to supply that load are described. Installation, maintenance,
    qualification, testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than
    nickel-cadmium batteries are not included. Design of the dc system and sizing
    of the battery charger(s) are also not included.
