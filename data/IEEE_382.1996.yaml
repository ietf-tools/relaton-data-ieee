abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 382-2006 The qualification of all types of power-driven
    valve actuators, including damper actuators, for safety-related functions in nuclear
    power generating stations, is described. This standard may also be used to separately
    qualify actuator components. The minimum requirements for, and guidance regarding,
    the methods and procedures for qualification of power-driven valve actuators with
    safety-related functions are provided.
