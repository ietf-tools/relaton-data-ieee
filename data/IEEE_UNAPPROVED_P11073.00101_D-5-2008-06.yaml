abstract:
- content: The following Guidance document addresses the use of radio frequency 1
    (RF) wireless technology for the transport of medical data both to and from point-of-care
    (PoC) medical devices. The context of such wireless medical data transport can
    range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary
    situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to
    wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise
    have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document
    several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities
    and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and
    adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving,
    and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication
    of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly
    prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless
    equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other
    end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and
    practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines
    specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies
    operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless
    metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations
    are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority,
    bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance
    (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless
    technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues
    include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security,
    cost, power consumption, and technology configurability. Performance summaries
    for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended
    as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes,
    and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is
    meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x
    standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies
    for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned
    to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for
    the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates
    will be performed on the IEEE 11073-0305.x standards only.
