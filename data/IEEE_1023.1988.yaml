abstract:
  content: Superseded. Guidance is provided to management and engineers who wish to
    develop an integrated program for the application of human factors engineering
    (HFE) in the design, operation, and maintenance of nuclear power generating stations.
    The standard covers the program organization and applicability, the plant design
    aspects to consider, the HFE methodologies that may be used, and a typical program
    plan for the application of HFE. It is applicable to new facilities or modifications
    to existing facilities.
