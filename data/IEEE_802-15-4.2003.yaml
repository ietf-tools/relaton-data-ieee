abstract:
  content: Superseded by IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006 IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003 defined the
    protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low-
    data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions
    in a wireless personal area network (WPAN). This revision extends the market applicability
    of IEEE Std 802.15.4, removes ambiguities in the standard, and makes improvements
    revealed by implementations of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003.
