abstract:
  content: Additional computer specific requirements to supplement the criteria and
    requirements of IEEE Std 603-2009 are specified. Within the context of this standard,
    the term computer is a system that includes computer hardware, software, firmware,
    and interfaces. The criteria contained herein, in conjunction with criteria in
    IEEE Std 603-2009, establish minimum functional and design requirements for computers
    used as components of a safety system.
