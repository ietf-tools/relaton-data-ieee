abstract:
- content: The evolution of technology and the advancement of communications have
    resulted in an increased awareness of energy bursts. Such bursts which interfere
    with desired signals are properly classified as noise. In the transmission of
    information, for example, signals which have low redundancy are highly vulnerable
    to burst interference. In acoustics, audible sound of the impulsive type is an
    increasingly important problem because of the annoyance it may cause; moreover,
    high-intensity solid-borne energy of an impulsive character sometimes produces
    structural failures. While quantities of relatively short time duration are of
    widespread interest, little is known about the statistics of these quantities
    insofar as peak amplitudes, repetition rates and wave shapes are concerned. In
    view of the increasingly important role played by energy bursts in modern technology,
    accepted procedures for identifying and characterizing burst-like events should
    be established. Obviously, no single method of measurement will satisfy all requirements
    equally well. The techniques described here are based on a set of definitions
    which have been chosen to be easily adaptable to many engineering applications.
