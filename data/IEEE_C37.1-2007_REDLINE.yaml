abstract:
- content: The requirements for SCADA and automation systems in substations are defined.
    This standard defines the process of substation integration as the design process
    that is the foundation for substation automation. Functional and environmental
    requirements are provided for all IEDs located in the system. Tutorial material
    is included in the annexes to address common issues with systems without introducing
    requirements. Information is also presented in the annexes regarding SCADA masters.
