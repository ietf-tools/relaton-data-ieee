abstract:
- content: In this IEEE Standard instructions for conducting and reporting the more
    generally applicable and acceptable tests to determine the performance characteristics
    of polyphase induction motors having liquid in the magnetic gap are given. Constants
    in several equations and forms apply to three-phase motors only and require modification
    for application to motors having another number of phases.
