abstract:
  content: This project will define a 25 to 100 GHz (millimeter wave) alternative
    PHY clause for higher data rate amendment to Standard 802.15.3-2003. This frequency
    range allows for the USA and Japanese unlicensed allocations and expected unlicensed
    allocations in other countries. Data rates will be at least 1 Gbps under normal
    operating conditions with a typical range no less than 10 meters.
