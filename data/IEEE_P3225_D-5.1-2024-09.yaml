abstract:
- content: The zone is the core unit of industrial development, and is an important
    component in both promoting urban development and achieving energy-conservation,
    emission-reduction. This standard defines the evaluation model and evaluation
    indicators system for low carbon zones based on blockchain technology. The technical
    and management requirements are also defined. The purpose is to support and promote
    the construction of a credible regulatory environment and carbon emission reduction
    ecosystem.
