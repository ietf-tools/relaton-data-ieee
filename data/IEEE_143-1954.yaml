abstract:
- content: Improvement in service reliability is a factor in power transmission and
    distribution which has received considerable emphasis in recent years. Several
    means for obtaining improvement in service reliability are in general use. These
    include ground-fault neutralizers, immediate reclosing of circuit breakers, overhead
    and buried ground wires, arresters and expulsion protector tubes. All have demonstrated
    an ability to limit outages on transmission and distribution systems. None of
    these means considered, however, has shown a perfect record in all cases of application.
