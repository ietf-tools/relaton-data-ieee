abstract:
- content: Terminology and standard test procedures are established for germanium
    gamma-ray detectors that are used for the detection and high-resolution spectrometry
    of gamma rays, X rays, and charged particles that produce hole-electron pairs
    in the crystal lattice so that these items have the same meaning to both manufacturers
    and users.
