abstract:
- content: 'Television and FM broadcast receivers are frequently potential sources
    of interference to other television and FM broadcast receivers and to receivers
    in other services. This standard defines a method for obtaining a measure of the
    emissions conducted by the power line from these potential interference sources
    in the frequency range of 300 kHz to 25 MHz. This standard describes standard
    input signals, the equipment setup, and measurement techniques. To perform the
    measurements described in this standard the following equipment is required: shielded
    room; a power line impedance stabilization network; (LISN); a source of a standard
    RF input signal; a tuned voltmeter; and a picture carrier intermediate frequency
    (IF) signal source (for television receivers only).<<ETX>>'
