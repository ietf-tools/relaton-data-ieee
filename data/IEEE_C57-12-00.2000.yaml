abstract:
- content: 'Superseded by IEEE Std C57.12.00-2006 Electrical,mechanical,and safety
    requirements are set forth for liquid-immersed distribution and power transformers,and
    autotransformers and regulating transformers; single and polyphase, with voltages
    of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding. This standard is a basis for
    the establishment of performance,limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability,
    and safety requirements of equipment described;and for assistance in the proper
    selection of such equipment. The requirements in this standard apply to all liquid-immersed
    distribution, power, and regulating transformers except the following: instrument
    transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers,
    rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding transformers, mobile
    transformers, and mine transformers.'
