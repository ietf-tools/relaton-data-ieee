abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a technical basis for implementation
    of electronic power subsystems. It is intended for electronic systems engineers
    and integrators, electronic power subsystem designers and integrators, as well
    as power element manufacturers and suppliers. It addresses system- level issues
    in element or subsystem integration, adaptation, and accommodation. It also defines
    system interface parameters, test methods, and test conditions. This recommended
    practice applies to ac&#8211;dc, dc-ac and dc&#8211;dc electronic power subsystems.
    The range of electronic power subsystems includes those with dc, single-phase,
    and three-phase inputs, having power levels from a fraction of a watt up to 20
    kW. The voltage range is 600 V and below at a frequency or frequencies of dc 1
    kHz. Internal operating frequencies within elements or subsystems may be much
    higher than 1 kHz. This recommended practice may be used outside the range where
    applicable. This recommended practice builds on and supplements IEEE Std 1515-2000.
