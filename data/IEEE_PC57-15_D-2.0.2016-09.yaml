abstract:
- content: Description of design types, tables of 50 Hz and 60 Hz ratings, supplementary
    ratings, construction, and available accessories are provided. Methods for performing
    routine and design tests applicable to liquid-immersed single and three-phase
    step-voltage regulators are described. Winding resistance measurements, polarity
    tests, insulation power factor and resistance tests, ratio tests, no load loss
    and excitation current measurements, impedance and load loss measurements, dielectric
    tests, temperature tests, routine and design impulse tests, short-circuit tests,
    audible sound emissions tests, enclosure integrity tests, tap-changer tests, control
    tests, calculated data, and certified test data are covered.
