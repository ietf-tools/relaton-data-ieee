abstract:
- content: Communication services to support information exchange between simulation
    applications participating in the distributed interactive simulation (DIS) environment
    are defined. These communication services describe a connectionless information
    transfer that supports real-time, as well as non-real-time, exchange. Several
    communication profiles specifying communication services are provided.
