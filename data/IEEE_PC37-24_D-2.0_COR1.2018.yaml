abstract:
- content: This corrigendum corrects an error where the user of this document was
    directed to gather the wrong column information from the NOAA website for use
    in calculations. The document erroneously directs the user to read from the monthly
    normal average temperature values from the website rather than the monthly normal
    maximum temperature values.
