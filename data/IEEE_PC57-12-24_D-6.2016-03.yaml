abstract:
- content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered
    in this standard, It also and takes into consideration certain safety features
    of three-phase, 60 Hz, liquid immersed, self-cooled, submersible transformers
    with separable insulated high-voltage connectors. These transformers are rated
    3750 kVA and smaller with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 V and below and
    with low voltages of 600 V and below.
