abstract:
- content: The recommended practices for the measurement of antenna transmitting and
    receiving properties are presented. Throughout this standard it is assumed that
    the antenna to be measured can be treated as a passive, linear, and reciprocal
    device. A fundamental property of any antenna is its radiation pattern. The measurement
    of radiation patterns in an antenna test facility is discussed. The design of
    antenna test facilities is described along with instrumentation requirements for
    the proper operation of the antenna facility, directions for the evaluation of
    an (existing) range, and the operation of ranges is discussed. References are
    provided that are illustrative of measurement techniques and in which details
    may be found.
