abstract:
- content: A common framework for sensor performance specification terminology, units,
    conditions, and limits is provided. Specifically, the accelerometer, magnetometer,
    gyrometer/gyroscope, accelerometer/magnetometer/gyroscope combination sensors,
    barometer/pressure sensors, hygrometer/humidity sensors, temperature sensors,
    light sensors (ambient and RGB), and proximity sensors are discussed.
