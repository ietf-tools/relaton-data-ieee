abstract:
  content: Motors used to drive valve operators in nuclear power generating stations
    are discussed. Guidelines to evaluate the adequacy of motors used to drive valve
    operators; to provide recommendations for motor application; and to provide methods
    for protection, control, and testing of motors used for valve operation are presented.
