abstract:
- content: 'Detailed procedures for analyzing gas from gas spaces or gas-collecting
    devices as well as gas dissolved in oil are described. The procedures cover: (1)
    the calibration and use of field instruments for detecting and estimating the
    amount of combustible gases present in gas blankets above oil, or in gas detector
    relays; (2) the use of fixed instruments for detecting and determining the quantity
    of combustible gases present in gas-blanketed equipment; (3) obtaining samples
    of gas and oil from the transformer for laboratory analysis; (4) laboratory methods
    for analyzing the gas blanket and the gases extracted from the oil; and (5) interpreting
    the results in terms of transformer serviceability. The intent is to provide the
    operator with positive and useful information concerning the serviceability of
    the equipment. An extensive bibliography on gas evolution, detection, and interpretation
    is included.'
