abstract:
- content: This standard covers electrical, mechanical, dimensional, and1 related
    requirements for non condenser bushings used in liquid immersed distribution transformers
    covered by IEEE Standards C57.12.20, C57.12.34, C57.12.36, and C57.12.38 and that
    have basic impulse insulation levels (BILs) of less than or equal to 200 kV. These
    requirements are to be interpreted, measured, or tested in accordance with IEEE
    Standards C57.19.00 unless otherwise stated in this standard
