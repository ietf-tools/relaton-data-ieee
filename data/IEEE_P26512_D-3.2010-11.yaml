abstract:
  content: 'This standard was developed to assist users of IEEE/ISO/IEC 15288:2008,
    Systems engineering &#8211;System life cycle processes, or IEEE/ISO/IEC 12207:2008,
    Information technology &#8211; Software life cycle processes, to acquire or supply
    software user documentation as part of the software life cycle processes. It defines
    the documentation process from the acquirer’s standpoint and the supplier’s standpoint.
    This standard covers the requirements for information items used in the acquisition
    of user documentation products: the Acquisition Plan, Document Specification,
    Statement of Work, Request for Proposals, and the proposal. It provides an overview
    of the software user documentation and information management processes which
    may require acquisition and supply of software user documentation products and
    services. It addresses the preparation of requirements for software user documentation.
    These requirements are central to the user documentation specification and Statement
    of Work. It includes requirements for primary document outputs of the acquisition
    and supply process: the Request for Proposal and the Proposal for user documentation
    products and services. It also discusses the use of a Documentation Management
    Plan and a Document Plan as they arise in the acquisition and supply processes.
    The standard is independent of the software tools that may be used to produce
    documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation.
    Much of its guidance is applicable to user documentation for systems including
    hardware as well as software.'
