abstract:
- content: Although the standard permissible operating temperatures of various types
    of equipment are different for one reason or another, this causes little or no
    difficulty except where two kinds of equipment with different temperature limits
    connect together directly. This guide is issued as an aid in determining proper
    cable termination practice, as related to temperature correlation, when making
    connections to electric equipment. The data presented in this guide supplements
    the standards of the AIEE or ASA and other applicable standards, which should
    be observed. This guide is prepared in the form of a general section which relates
    to the temperature correlation problem as a whole, covering those points which
    are common. Individual equipment sections may be issued later and will consider
    special aspects identified with particular types of power equipment.
