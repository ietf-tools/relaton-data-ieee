abstract:
- content: Superseded. IEEE Recommended Practice for Minimization of Interference
    from Radio-Frequency Heating Equipment, describes procedures that may be applied
    in the design and construction of radio-frequency heating equipment used for heating
    in industrial and other purposes, excluding applications in the field of telecommunication
    and information technology. These procedures are intended to reduce the amount
    of radio-frequency energy leaks, which can interfere with other equipment and
    broadcast services; they may also be used as remedial measures when harmful interference
    occurs.
