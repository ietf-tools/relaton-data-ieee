abstract:
- content: Superseded. This document recommends methods and design features that,
    if implemented, would provide water-hazard protection to class 1E and non-class
    1E systems and equipment from direct sources of water (for example, water spray
    from decontamination activities) and indirect sources of water (for example, water
    running along cables and raceways). It is not the purpose of this recommended
    practice to classify water-hazard protection features as nuclear safety related
    or non-nuclear safety related. This determination is application specific and
    is made by the user utilizing the specific nuclear generating station design basis
    and guidance from other standards.
