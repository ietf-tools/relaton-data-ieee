abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 establishes a common framework for system life cycle
    processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by any party,
    particularly those having any involvement or interest in the system life cycle
    or performance of systems engineering activities. It applies to the acquisition
    of systems, which can be comprised of products, services, or both, as well as
    to the supply, development, operation, maintenance, and disposal of systems, whether
    performed internally or externally to an organization. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 may
    be used stand-alone or jointly with other International Standards, such as ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207, and supplies a process reference model that supports process capability
    assessment according to ISO/IEC 33002.
