abstract:
- content: Interoperability between components of automatic test systems (ATS) is
    promoted and facilitated. The standard facilitates the capture of maintenance
    action information (MAI) associated with the removal, repair, and replacement
    of a particular system component (e.g., unit(s) under test) in order to maintain/support
    that particular operational system. The MAI schema becomes a class of information
    that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards. The exchange format utilizes
    the XML formats.
