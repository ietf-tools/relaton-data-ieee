abstract:
- content: Recommendations provide guidance in the implementation of the generic standard
    IEEE Std 1301-1991, and the connector-related standards, such as IEEE Std 1301.1-1991
    and IEEE Std 1301.3-1992. This recommended practice may be applied in all fields
    of electronics where equipment and installations are required to conform to a
    metric modular order. The IEEE 1301 metric equipment practices are in accordance
    with IEC 917 (1988) and IEC 917-0 (1989), including cabinet, rack, subracks, printed
    boards, and common connector-dependent dimensions for connector pitches of 2.5,
    2.0, 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 mm.<<ETX>>
