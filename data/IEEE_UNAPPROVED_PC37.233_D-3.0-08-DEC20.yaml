abstract:
- content: This guide covers suggested test requirements for Power System Protection
    Scheme Testing, System Application Tests, the scope and level of tests based on
    the application, and benefits of the overall protective schemes testing. This
    guide encompasses overall system testing procedures (generators, line, line reactors,
    transformer, capacitors, Special protection schemes, end-to-end testing, distributed
    application within substation, etc.), data collection requirements, as well as
    the test procedure definitions. The Guide describes the methods, extent, and types
    of system tests for protection applications, at various voltage levels. Control
    functions which are inherent to the protective systems are included. Importance
    of line testing, indirect trip applications, and open / closed loop tests (dynamic
    / non-linear tests) are also covered.
