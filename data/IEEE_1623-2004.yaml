abstract:
- content: 'This document provides general guidelines for the preparation of a functional
    specification for solid-state electronic shunt devices used mainly for compensation
    of voltage fluctuation. The guide covers devices rated to medium voltage (1 kV-35
    kV). This device contains in general: an inverter, rectifier or DC converter,
    energy storage device, and coupling transformer. The device typically is connected
    in parallel with the network using a coupling transformer.'
