abstract:
  content: Superseded. The definition and application of function numbers for devices
    used in electrical substations and generating plants and in installations of power
    utilization and conversion apparatus are covered. The purpose of the numbers is
    discussed, and 94 numbers are assigned. The use of prefixes and suffixes to provide
    a more specific definition of the function is considered. Device contact designation
    is also covered.
