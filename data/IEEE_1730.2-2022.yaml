abstract:
- content: The Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) identifies
    best practices for the development and execution of distributed simulations. This
    recommended practice provides guidelines for verification, validation, and acceptance
    or accreditation (VV&amp;A) of a distributed simulation and provides a more detailed
    view of the VV&amp;A processes implied by and aligned with the DSEEP.
