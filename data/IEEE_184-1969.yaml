abstract:
- content: This Test Procedure covers definition of terms, controlled test conditions,
    test apparatus, test methods, and data presentation, which form the basis for
    establishing performance criteria of mobile communication receivers designed to
    receive frequency-modulated waves in the frequency range from 25 to 1000 megahertz.
    Specific limits are not included; however, reference values that are not limited
    by the state of the art are provided. Test conditions, apparatus, and methods
    are based on known instrumentation and measuring techniques and are not restricted
    to any special apparatus other than necessary terminal simulators. Presentation
    of data has been standardized to the three forms of tabular, graphical, and empirical
    equations.
