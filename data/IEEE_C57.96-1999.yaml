abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2004. General recommendations for the loading of dry-type distribution
    and power transformers that have 80 C, 115 C, and 150 C average winding rises
    and insulation systems limited to 150 C, 180 C, and 220 C maximum hottest-spot
    operating temperatures, respectively, are covered in this guide. Recommendations
    for ventilated, nonventilated, and sealed dry-type transformers having impregnated
    insulation systems are included.
