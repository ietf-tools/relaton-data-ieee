abstract:
- content: The guidelines are provided for assessing, monitoring, and mitigating degradation
    of Class 1E equipment used in nuclear power generating stations due to aging.
    The methods described can be used to identify the performance capability of Class
    1E equipment beyond its qualified life. A discussion of stressors and aging mechanisms
    is included. If aging considerations have been satisfactorily addressed through
    other means (e.g., equipment qualification), then use of this guide may not be
    warranted. For some equipment, only partial application of this guide may be warranted.
