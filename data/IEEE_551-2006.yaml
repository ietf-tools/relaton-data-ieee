abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides short-circuit current information including
    calculated short-circuit current duties for the application in industrial plants
    and commercial buildings, at all power system voltages, of power system equipment
    that senses, carries, or interrupts short-circuit currents. Equipment coverage
    includes, but should not be limited to, protective device sensors such as series
    trips and relays, passive equipment that may carry short circuit current such
    as bus, cable, reactors, and transformers as well as interrupters such as circuit
    breakers and fuses.
