abstract:
  content: This standard is intended to set forth characteristics relating t 1 o performance,
    limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and to assist in the proper
    selection of said equipment. Specific rating combinations are described in the
    range from 750 to 5000 kVA inclusive, with high-voltage 2400 to 34500 Volts inclusive
    and low-voltage 208Y/120 to 4160 Volts inclusive. Sealed dry-type power transformers
    filled with only dry air or nitrogen, at the time of filling, are considered.
    Other gases are not considered in this standard. This standard does not apply
    to other types of transformers, such as specialty, ventilated dry-type, pad-mounted
    dry type, liquid immersed, instrument, regulating, furnace, mine and rectifier
    transformers.
