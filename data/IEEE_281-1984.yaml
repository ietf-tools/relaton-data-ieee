abstract:
- content: This is a revision of a standard for the usual and unusual service conditions
    for power system communication equipment. It is similar to service conditions
    for relays, automatic station supervisory control, and telemetering equipment
    with which this communication equipment is used. IEEE Std 97-1969, IEEE Recommended
    Practice for Specifying Service Conditions in Electrical Standards, has been considered.
