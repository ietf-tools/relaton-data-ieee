abstract:
- content: This standard presents safe and reliable methods for the electrical protection
    of telecommunication facilities serving electric supply locations through the
    use of metallic wire-line components in part of the telecommunication circuit
    and optical fiber systems in the reminder of the telecommunication circuit. Hybrid
    applications have an equipment junction between the metallic wire-line and the
    fiber cable (CFJ or wire-line-fiber cable junction).
