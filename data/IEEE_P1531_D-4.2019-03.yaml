abstract:
- content: Guidelines for the specification of components, protection, and control
    of harmonic filters are provided in this guide. The guide applies to the use of
    50 Hz and 60 Hz passive shunt power harmonic filters on low-voltage, medium-voltage,
    and high-voltage electric power systems. This document is specifically created
    for harmonic filters, although standards do exist for most of the components that
    are used in a filter. Applications including industrial low-voltage facilities,
    utility medium-voltage systems, and arc furnace installations are covered.
