abstract:
- content: Defined is a standard for high speed communication devices via electric
    power lines, so called Broadband over Power Line (BPL) devices. The standard uses
    transmission frequencies below 100 MHz. This standard is usable by all classes
    of BPL devices, including BPL devices used for the first-mile/last mile connection
    to broadband services as well as BPL devices used in buildings for LANs, Smart
    Energy applications, transportation platforms (vehicle) applications, and other
    data distribution. This standard focuses on the balanced and efficient use of
    the power line communications channel by all classes of BPL devices, defining
    detailed mechanisms for coexistence and interoperability between different BPL
    devices, and ensuring that desired bandwidth and quality of service may be delivered.
    The standard addresses the necessary security questions to ensure the privacy
    of communications between users and allow the use of BPL for security sensitive
    services.
