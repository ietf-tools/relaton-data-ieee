abstract:
- content: Detailed procedures are provided for reclaiming used mineral insulating
    oils (transformer oils) by chemical and mechanical means to make them suitable
    for reuse as insulating fluids. Reclamation procedures are described, as are the
    test methods used to evaluate the progress and end point of the reclamation process
    and the essential properties required for reuse in each class of equipment. Suitable
    criteria for the use of reclaimed oils are identified. The use of oil in new apparatus
    under warranty is not covered.
