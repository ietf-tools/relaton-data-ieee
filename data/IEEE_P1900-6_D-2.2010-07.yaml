abstract:
- content: This standard defines the interfaces and data structures required to exchange
    sensing related information in order to increase interoperability between sensors
    and their clients developed by different manufacturers. The logical interface
    and supporting data structures are defined abstractly without constraining the
    sensing technology, client design, or data link between sensor and client. The
    standard defines the entities involved and parameters exchanged in this process.
    It further elaborates on the service access points, service primitives, as well
    as generic procedures used to realize this information exchange.
