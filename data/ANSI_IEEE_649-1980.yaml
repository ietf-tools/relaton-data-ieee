abstract:
- content: The manufacturers and users of Class 1E motor control centers are required
    to provide assurance that such equipment will meet or exceed its specific performance
    requirements throughout its installed life. This is accomplished through a quality
    assurance program that includes, but is not limited to, design, qualification,
    production quality control, installation, maintenance, and periodic testing. This
    document treats only the qualification portion of the program. The purpose of
    the qualification program is to provide assurance, by demonstration, that the
    motor control center is capable of performing its required Class 1E functions
    before, during, and after the postulated design basis events specified for that
    equipment. Qualification may be accomplished by testing, analysis, previous operating
    experience, or a combination thereof. This standard provides qualification procedures
    for both testing and analysis. Ongoing qualification may be used to extend the
    qualified life of equipment that has been previously qualified by other means.
