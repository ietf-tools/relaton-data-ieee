abstract:
- content: The expanding use of digital communications among subsystems of the transportation
    infrastructure has spawned the development of message sets for the communications
    between these subsystems. A format for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)
    message sets, including common terms (e.g., object identifier), as well as attributes
    necessary to document ITS data messages, is addressed in this standard.
