- content: A method for host authentication of removable storage devices and an optional
    method for authentication of hosts by removable storage devices are specified
    by this standard. Both methods are certificate based and manageable by device
    owners. In addition, a method for identifying non-storage capabilities of removable
    storage devices is specified.
