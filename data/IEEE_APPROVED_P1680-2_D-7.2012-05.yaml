abstract:
  content: This standard establishes a clear and consistent set of environmental performance
    criteria for the design of imaging equipment products, providing an opportunity
    to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of
    electronic products. This standard is also intended to provide a tool for government,
    institutional, corporate and consumer purchasers to identify products that demonstrate
    environmental leadership. The intent is that the standard will be updated and
    revised on a periodic basis to continue to set a higher performance standard for
    leadership products.
