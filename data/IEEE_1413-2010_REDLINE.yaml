abstract:
- content: The framework for the reliability prediction for electronic hardware is
    covered in this standard. This standard identifies required elements for an understandable
    and credible reliability prediction with information to evaluate the effective
    use of the prediction results. A reliability prediction generated according to
    this standard shall have sufficient information concerning inputs, assumptions,
    data sources, methodology(ies), and uncertainties so that the risk associated
    with using the prediction results can be considered. This document does not provide
    instructions for how to perform reliability prediction and does not judge methodologies.
