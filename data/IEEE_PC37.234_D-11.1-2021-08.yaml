abstract:
- content: Principles of power bus protection are discussed. The availability and
    location of breakers, current sensing devices, and disconnect switches are addressed,
    as well as bus configurations and switching schemes and their impact on the selection
    and application of bus protection. Bus protection schemes are presented, and their
    characteristics, strengths, and limitations are examined. Bus protection applications
    are presented.
