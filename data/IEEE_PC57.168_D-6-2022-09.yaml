abstract:
- content: The Guide for Low Frequency Dielectric Testing for Distribution, Power,
    and Regulating Transformers provides background on various low frequency test
    methods as well as guidance on how to conduct and interpret the results. Common
    pitfalls to avoid are presented along with compiled guidance on interpreting the
    results and where possible methods for correcting test issues.
