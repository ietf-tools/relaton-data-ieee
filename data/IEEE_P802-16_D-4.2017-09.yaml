abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access
    control layer (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint
    broadband wireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is
    structured to support the WirelessMAN-SC, WirelessMAN-OFDM, and WirelessMAN-OFDMA
    PHY specifications, each suited to a particular operational environment. The standard
    enables rapid worldwide deployment of innovative, cost-effective, and interoperable
    multi-vendor broadband wireless access products, facilitates competition in broadband
    access by providing alternatives to wireline broadband access, encourages consistent
    worldwide spectrum allocation, and accelerates the commercialization of broadband
    wireless access systems.
