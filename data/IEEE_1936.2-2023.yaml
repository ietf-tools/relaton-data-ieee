abstract:
- content: With the popular application of civil light and small unmanned aircraft
    systems in engineering surveying, UAS photogrammetry is increasingly used for
    the production of mapping results for overhead transmission line engineering.
    In order to unify the requirements and confirm that the mapping results meet the
    engineering surveying requirements of overhead transmission lines. The technical
    requirements for civil light and small UAS photogrammetry for overhead transmission
    line engineering, UAS photography, control survey and annotation, aerial data
    processing and 3D digital mapping is specified in this standard. The key technical
    indicators of each link of office work and field work in respect of light and
    small UAS photogrammetry for overhead transmission line engineering, and a unified
    criteria for UAS application in overhead transmission line engineering are also
    defined and provided in this standard.
