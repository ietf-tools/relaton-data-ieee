abstract:
  content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are set
    forth as well as certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz., mineral-oil-immersed,
    self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers. These
    transformers are rated 2500 kVA and smaller, with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY
    / 19 920 volts and below, and with low voltages of 480 volts and below. This standard
    covers the connector, bushing and terminal arrangements for radial or loop feed
    systems. This standard does not cover the electrical and mechanical requirements
    of any accessory devices that may be supplied with the transformer.
