abstract:
- content: This document defines recommended practices for World Wide Web page engineering
    for Intranet and Extranet environments, based on World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
    and related industry guidelines. This recommended practice does not address stylistic
    considerations or human-factors considerations in Web page design beyond limitations
    that reflect good engineering practice. Annex B contains topics which are not
    sufficiently mature or where there are not specific recommendations for inclusion
    in the current issue of this recommended practice.
