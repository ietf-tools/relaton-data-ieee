abstract:
- content: The technical and managerial requirements for operational maintenance,
    repair, and tests of distributed control systems (DCSs) in power stations are
    specified. This standard is applicable to the operational maintenance, repair,
    and tests of DCSs in conventional thermal power stations after commencement of
    commercial operation.
