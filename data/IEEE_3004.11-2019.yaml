abstract:
- content: Covered in this recommended practice is the protection of bus and switchgear
    used in industrial and commercial power systems. Also provided are fault protection
    and isolation strategies for the substation bus and switchgear, including the
    bus, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnecting devices, transformers, and the structures
    on which they are mounted.
