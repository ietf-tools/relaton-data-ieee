abstract:
- content: This standard applies to applications of electric energy storage equipment
    and systems (electric energy storage equipment and systems, ESS) for electric
    power systems (electric power systems, EPS). It provides the testing items and
    procedures, including type test, production test, installation evaluation, commissioning
    test at site and periodic test, in order to verify whether ESS applied in EPS
    meets the safety and reliability requirements of EPS. This standard is established
    for users including grid operators, ESS manufactures and ESS operators.
