abstract:
- content: This standard applies to Surge-protective Devices (SPDs) intended to be
    installed on the load side of the service equipment connected to 50 Hz or 60 Hz
    AC power circuits rated at 1000 V (rms) or less. Performance characteristics and
    standard methods for testing and rating are established for these devices, which
    may be composed of any combination of components. The tests in this standard are
    aimed at providing comparisons among the variety of surge-protective devices available.
