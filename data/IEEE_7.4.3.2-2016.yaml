abstract:
- content: Additional specific requirements to supplement the criteria and requirements
    of IEEE Std 603(TM) are specified for programmable digital devices. Within the
    context of this standard, the term programmable digital device is any device that
    relies on software instructions or programmable logic to accomplish a function.
    Examples include a computer, a programmable hardware device, or a device with
    firmware. Systems using these devices will also be referred to as digital safety
    systems in this standard. The criteria contained herein, in conjunction with criteria
    in IEEE Std 603, establish minimum functional and design requirements for programmable
    digital devices used as components of a safety system.
