abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide an ad hoc test
    method to estimate the electromagnetic immunity of medical devices and help identify
    interference issues that might exist with critical medical devices as a result
    of emissions from RF transmitters increasingly used in health-care facilities,
    particularly by doctors, staff, patients, and visitors. RF transmitters include
    two-way radios, walkie-talkies, mobile phones, wireless-enabled laptop computers
    and similar devices, RFID readers, networked mp3 players, two-way pagers, wireless
    PDAs, and wireless medical devices. The test protocol is designed to be performed
    as follows: a) By clinical engineers, biomedical engineers, and other technical
    personnel b) In a way that is relatively rapid and practical c) In an area and
    with equipment that are commonly available d) To identify specific effects and
    thresholds (i.e., transmit power and distance) to provide the basic information
    needed to develop a mitigation action plan e) To generate test results that can
    be used in the formulation of policies and procedures for managing the use of
    RF transmitters within a health-care facility. A preferred method (5.6.2) and
    several alternative RF sources and methods (Annex C) for ad hoc testing are outlined
    in this recommended practice to allow flexibility with regard to the time, personnel,
    and resources available to perform the testing. As a result, these different options
    provide different levels of accuracy and comprehensiveness. The most appropriate
    ad hoc test strategy will depend on the needs and resources of the user of this
    recommended practice. This recommended practice also provides guidance for selection
    of the medical devices to be tested, operation of RF transmitters used as RF test
    sources, and assessment of test results. The preferred method for evaluation in
    most circumstances involves the use of the actual RF transmitter(s) (e.g., mobile
    phones and portable and mobile radios) as test sources to generate the same RF
    signals that would be encountered in the health-care facility. This approach also
    assumes that the end user has limited time and resources, a small number of critical
    medical devices to test, a limited space in which to perform the testing, and
    a single or a small number of specific RF transmitter signals to examine. In this
    preferred method, the RF transmitter is placed in a constantly transmitting state
    (i.e., test mode). The tests can be performed with or without an electric-field-strength
    (E-field) meter, although the use of an E-field meter is recommended. Another
    important function of this recommended practice is to define a consistent test
    protocol to allow results to be obtained and compared within and across institutions.
    Clinical and biomedical engineers have performed their own rudimentary (ad hoc)
    electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing using in-house methodology, RF transmitter
    sources, and medical devices. As a result, a comparison of the findings between
    health-care organizations might not be appropriate. To facilitate a comparison
    between health-care organizations, it is important that the recommendations herein
    are followed, deviations are kept to a minimum, and the testing is performed as
    consistently as possible. Policies and procedures for mitigation of electromagnetic
    interference (EMI)^2 in health-care facilities, including the use or restriction
    of specific RF transmitters within specific areas, often called an exclusion zone,
    should be based on objective information, including that obtained by the use of
    this test method. A common problem with exclusion zones is that they are difficult
    to enforce. With regard to purchase evaluation, confirming that medical devices
    conform to voluntary EMC immunity standards can provide some information, although
    many RF transmitters are able to exceed these immunity levels greatly when held
    close to a medical device.'
