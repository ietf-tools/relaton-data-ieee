abstract:
- content: Use of electrical power on the seabed is increasing. Both within the oil
    and gas and renewable industries there is an increasing use of electrical power
    equipment on the seabed. Subsea processing activities like compression and pumping
    require an increasingly higher amount of electrical power. Power generation, whether
    onshore or offshore requires development of equipment both for subsea transmission
    and distribution. This standard includes requirements related to equipment installed
    below the sea surface. The objective of this standard is to substitute project/client
    specific specifications are used both for design and testing.
