abstract:
- content: 'This standard describes parameters and methods of measurement suitable
    for the characterization of varactors intended for large-signal application. This
    will be done by reference to the parameters and methods prescribed in IEEE Std
    318-1971, Trial-Use Guide on Solid-State Devices: Varactor Measurements, Part
    I - Small Signal Measurements, where they are applicable, and by modification
    and supplementation of them where necessary for use with large-signal devices.'
