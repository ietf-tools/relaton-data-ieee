abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. Methods and requirements for qualifying switchgear assemblies
    for indoor areas outside of the containment area in nuclear power generating stations
    are described. These assemblies include metal-enclosed low-voltage power circuit
    breaker switchgear assemblies, metal-clad switchgear assemblies, and metal-enclosed
    interrupter switchgear assemblies. This standard amplifies the general requirements
    of ANSI/IEEE 323-1983, IEEE Standard for Qualifying Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear
    Power Generating Stations, as they apply to Class 1E switchgear assemblies.
