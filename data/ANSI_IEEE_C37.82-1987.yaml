abstract:
- content: ANSI/IEEE Std 323-1984, IEEE Standard for Qualifying Class IE Equipment
    for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, was developed to provide qualification
    requirements for Class IE (safety-related) electrical equipments that would confirm
    the adequacy of such equipments to perform their safety functions on a continuing
    basis throughout their installed life. This document is based on ANSI/IEEE Std
    323-1983 and is intended to present specific qualification procedures for switchgear
    assemblies in Class IE application.
