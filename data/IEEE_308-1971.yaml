abstract:
- content: This standard applies to those parts of the electric systems in stationery
    single-unit and multi-unit land-based nuclear power generating stations that provide
    electric power to the Class IE electric equipment. The electric systems included
    are comprised of the following interrelated systems" (1) alternating-current power
    systems, (2) direct-current power systems, (3) vital instrumentation and control
    power systems. These systems consist of power supplies (e.g., connections to the
    station switchyard, stand-by generators, batteries), distribution equipment and
    components (e.g, transformers, switchgear, bus cable, battery chargers, inverters),
    and instrumentation and controls (e.g., relays, meters, switches, control devices).
    This standard does not apply to the unit generator(s) and their buses, step-up
    and auxiliary transformers, switchyard, transmission lines and transmission network.
