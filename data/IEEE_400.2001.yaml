abstract:
- content: This Guide lists the various field test methods that are currently available
    or underdevelopment with guidance on HOW to perform each test. The Guide covers
    shielded, insulatedpower cable systems rated 5 kV through 500 kV unless these
    voltages are modified by the specific "point" document.
