abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the air interface, including the medium access
    control layer (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint
    broadband wireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is
    structured to support multiple PHY specifications, each suited to a particular
    operational environment.
