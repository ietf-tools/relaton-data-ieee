abstract:
- content: This paper is the international standard IEC/ISO/IEEE 80005-1. The intention
    of this standard is to define requirements that support, with the application
    of suitable operating practices, efficiency and safety of connections by compliant
    ships to compliant high-voltage shore power supplies through a compatible shore
    to ship connection.
