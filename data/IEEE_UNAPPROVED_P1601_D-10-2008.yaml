abstract:
- content: This trial-use standard is intended for use as a basis for describing the
    performance of optical current and voltage measurement systems used in the generation,
    transmission, and distribution of alternating current electricity, and to assist
    in the proper selection of such equipment. This trial-use standard covers certain
    physical characteristics of the sensing systems that use optical techniques to
    measure current and voltage. This trial-use standard provides the requirements
    for the performance characteristics and the test of optical current and voltage
    sensors of a nominal system voltage of 1 kV and above, the information related
    to the nature of these sensors, and the information related to the application
    and use of these sensors.
