abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to specify interrelating mechanical and
    electrical properties so that quartz-fiber exposure meters may be used with any
    charger. Other characteristics peculiar to these devices but not affecting the
    interrelationship between chargers and exposure meters are purposely omitted.<<ETX>>
