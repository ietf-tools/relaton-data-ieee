abstract:
- content: The basic requirements for qualifying Class 1E equipment and interfaces
    that are to be used in nuclear power generating stations are described in this
    standard. The principles, methods, and procedures described are intended to be
    used for qualifying equipment, maintaining and extending qualification, and updating
    qualification, as required, if the equipment is modified. The qualification requirements
    in this standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability of equipment
    to perform safety function(s) under applicable service conditions including design
    basis events, reducing the risk of common-cause equipment failure.
