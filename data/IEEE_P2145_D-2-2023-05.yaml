abstract:
- content: Provided in this standard is a common nomenclature and framework for describing
    blockchain governance across all use cases and contexts, including public, private,
    permissioned, permissionless, and hybrid. The standard is only normative regarding
    terminology. It is non-normative with respect to the design of particular blockchain
    protocols and systems. Where two terms are in common use for one concept, the
    standard shall define both terms and elaborate on any meaningful distinctions
    between them.
