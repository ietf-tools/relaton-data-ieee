abstract:
- content: The qualification of all types of power-driven valve actuators, including
    damper actuators, for safety-related functions in nuclear power generating stations,
    is described. This standard may also be used to separately qualify actuator components.
    The minimum requirements for, and guidance regarding, the methods and procedures
    for qualification of power-driven valve actuators with safety-related functions
    are provided.
