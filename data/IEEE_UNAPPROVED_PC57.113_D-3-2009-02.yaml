abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is focused on the wide-band measurement of the
    apparent charge of partial discharges (PD) which may occur in liquid-filled power
    transformers and shunt reactors excited by AC test voltages between 40 and 400
    Hz. The major components of the PD measuring circuit including the calibrator
    are specified in compliance with the relevant standard IEC 60270. Furthermore
    the PD test procedure is described and recommendations for the evaluation of PD
    test results are presented.
