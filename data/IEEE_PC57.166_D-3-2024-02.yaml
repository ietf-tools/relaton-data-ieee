abstract:
- content: Recommendations are made regarding tests and evaluation procedures of insulating
    liquids; references are made to methods of reconditioning and reclaiming insulating
    liquids; the levels at which these methods become necessary. The intent is to
    assist the power equipment operator in evaluating the serviceability of liquid
    insulation received in equipment, as received from the supplier for filling new
    equipment at the installation site, and as processed into such equipment; and
    to assist the operator in maintaining the insulating liquid in serviceable condition.
    The insulating liquids covered are used in transformers, reactors, load tap changers,
    and voltage regulators
