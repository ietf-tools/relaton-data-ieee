abstract:
- content: This amendment provides two PHYs (MSK and LRP UWB) that can be used in
    a wide range of applications requiring various combinations of low cost, low energy
    consumption, multi-year battery life, reliable communications, precision location,
    and reader options. This PHY standard supports the performance and flexibility
    needed for future mass deployments of highly populated autonomous active RFID
    systems anywhere in the world.
