abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the design requirements for new and/or modified
    Class 1E control boards, panels, and racks and establishes the methods to verify
    that these requirements have been satisfied. Methods for meeting the separation
    criteria contained in IEEE Std 384 are addressed. Qualification is also included
    to address the overall requirements of IEEE Std 323 and recommendations of IEEE
    Std 344.
