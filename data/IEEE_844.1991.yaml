abstract:
- content: Recommended practices are provided for the design, installation, testing,
    operation and maintenance of impedance, induction, and skin-effect heating systems.
    Thermal insulation and control and monitoring are addressed. General considerations
    for heating systems are discussed, covering selection criteria, design guidelines
    and considerations, power systems, receiving and storage, installation, testing,
    operations, and maintenance. These aspects are then discussed for each of the
    above types of systems, along with special considerations particular to each.
    These recommended practices are intended to apply to the use of these heating
    systems in general industry.
