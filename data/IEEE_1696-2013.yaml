abstract:
- content: Currently, no defined, industry-accepted method exists for characterizing
    the performance of electrical circuit probes. Each vendor has its own proprietary
    methods for characterization, leaving probe customers and users without a valid
    means of comparing probe performance and/or of understanding the circuit-loading
    effect of the probe. Methods for measuring parameters indicative of a probes or
    probe systems performance and guidance on the design and use of a test fixture
    for measuring probe performance are provided by this standard. An industry-accepted,
    unbiased means for characterizing probe performance is given by these methods.
    High-impedance voltage probes that are used to measure the performance of electrical
    circuits are considered by this standard. The probe systems may include waveform
    acquisition hardware and software and signal/waveform analysis software. The probe
    will include the mechanism by which the circuit is contacted. This method and
    standard will be applicable toall individual probes having one signal conductor
    and one ground conductor or two signal conductors, and having an input impedance
    at least five times greater than the impedance of the circuit under test.
