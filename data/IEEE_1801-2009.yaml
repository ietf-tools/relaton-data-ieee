abstract:
- content: The power supplied to elements in an electronic design affects the way
    circuits operate. Although this is obvious when stated, today's set of high-level
    design languages have not had a consistent way to concisely represent the regions
    of a design with different power provisions, nor the states of those regions or
    domains. This standard provides an HDL-independent way of annotating a design
    with power intent. In addition, the level-shifting and isolation between power
    domains may be described for a specific implementation, from high-level constraints
    to particular configurations. When the logic in a power domain receives different
    power supply levels, the logic state of portions of the design may be preserved
    with various state-retention strategies. This standard provides mechanisms for
    the refined and specific description of intent, effect, and implementation of
    various retention strategies. Incorporating components into designs is greatly
    assisted by the encapsulation and specification of the characteristics of the
    power environment of the design and the power requirements and capabilities of
    the components; this information encapsulation mechanism is also described in
    this standard. The analysis of the various power modes of a design is enabled
    with a combination of the description of the power modes and the collection, generation,
    and propagation of switching information.
