abstract:
- content: The current methodologies, including apparatus, procedures, and measurement
    accuracies, for determining the dynamic characteristics of vibration dampers and
    damping systems are described. Some basic guidance is provided regarding a given
    method's strengths and weaknesses. The methodologies and procedures described
    are applicable to indoor testing only.
