abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the general technical framework, components, integration,
    and main business processes of augmented reality systems applied to mobile devices,
    and defines its technical requirements, including functional requirements, performance
    requirements and the corresponding test methods. The target applications and services
    include but are not limited to the design, development, and management of augmented
    reality and mixed reality enabled applications or features of applications on
    mobile devices.
