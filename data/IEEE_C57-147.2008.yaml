abstract:
- content: The evaluation and handling procedures for natural ester transformer insulating
    fluids are covered. The transformer operator is assisted by the purpose of the
    guide, which is to evaluate the serviceability of new, unused fluids being received
    by the equipment manufacturer or service company and fluid in new equipment. The
    operator is also assisted by the guide in maintaining the fluids in serviceable
    condition.
