abstract:
- content: Information on the concepts of protection of ac transmission 1ines is presented
    in this guide. Applications of the concepts to accepted transmission line protection
    schemes are presented as well. Many important issues, such as coordination of
    settings, operating times, characteristics of relays, mutual coupling of lines,
    automatic reclosing, use of communication channels, are examined. Special protection
    systems, protection of multi-terminal lines and single6phase tripping and reclosing
    are also included. The impact of different electrical parameters and system performance
    considerations on the selection of relays and protection schemes is discussed
    as well. The purpose of this guide is to provide a reference for the selection
    of relay schemes and to assist less experienced protective relaying engineers
    in applying protection schemes to transmission lines.
