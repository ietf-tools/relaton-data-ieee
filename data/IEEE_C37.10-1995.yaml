abstract:
- content: In this IEEE standard procedures to be used to perform failure investigations
    of power circuit breakers are recommended. Although the procedure may be used
    for any circuit breaker, it is mainly focused on high-voltage Ac power circuit
    breakers used on utility systems. Recommendations are also made for monitoring
    circuit breaker functions as a means of diagnosing their suitability for service
    condition.
