abstract:
- content: Procedures to be used to perform failure investigations of power circuit
    breakers are recommended. Although the procedure may be used for any circuit breaker,
    it is mainly focused on high-voltage ac power circuit breakers used on utility
    systems. Recommendations are also made for monitoring circuit breaker functions
    as a means of diagnosing their suitability for service condition.
