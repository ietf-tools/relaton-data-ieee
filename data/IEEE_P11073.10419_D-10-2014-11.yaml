abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of communication between personal telehealth
    insulin pump devices and compute engines (e.g. cell phones, personal computers,
    personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play
    interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including
    ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models, application profile standards,
    and transport standards. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats,
    and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks
    in favor of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication
    functionality for personal telehealth insulin pump devices.
