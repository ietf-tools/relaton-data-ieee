abstract:
- content: 'This standard establishes criteria for design analysis for qualification,
    quality, and reliability of rechargeable battery systems for multi-cell mobile
    computing devices. It also provides methods for quantifying the operational performance
    of these batteries and their associated management and control systems including
    considerations for end-user notification. This standard covers rechargeable battery
    systems for mobile computing. The battery technologies covered are limited to
    Li-ion and Li-ion polymer, but future versions of this standard may include technologies
    that are not in general use at present. Also included are: battery pack electrical
    and mechanical construction; system, pack, and cell level charge and discharge
    controls; and battery status communications. The following are addressed: qualification
    process; manufacturing process control; energy capacity and demand management;
    levels of management and control in the battery systems; and current and planned
    lithium-based battery chemistries, packaging technologies, and considerations
    for end-user notification.'
