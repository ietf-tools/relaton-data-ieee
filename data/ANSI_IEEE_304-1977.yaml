abstract:
- content: Insulation systems for direct-current machines are classified in accordance
    with their limiting temperatures as determined by test rather than by chemical
    composition. The intention is to classify according to the recognized A, B, F,
    and H categories by determining thermal capability in accordance with machine
    temperature-rise standards. This test procedure has been prepared to indicate
    accepted tests. It is applicable to insulation systems for use in usual service
    conditions. This standard does not cover special requirements such as for machines
    in gas atmospheres being subjected to strong chemicals, metal dusts, or submersion
    in liquids.
