abstract:
  content: The specific test requirements for qualifying electrical resistance heating
    cables for industrial service are provided, as well as the basis for electrical
    and thermal design. Heating device characteristics are addressed, and installation
    and maintenance requirements are detailed. Heating cable and surface heating device
    application recommendations and requirements are made for ordinary (unclassified)
    and hazardous (classified) potentially flammable atmospheres and locations.
