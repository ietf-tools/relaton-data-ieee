abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1137-1991 provides guidance for controlling or modifying the inductive
    environment and the susceptibility of affected wire line telecommunications facilities
    in order to operate within the acceptable levels of steady-state or surge induced
    voltages of the environmental interface (probe wire) defined by IEEE Std 776-1987
    (Guide for Inductive Coordination of Electric Supply and Communications Lines).
    Procedures for determining the source of the problem are given. Mitigation theory
    and philosophy are discussed, and mitigation devices are described. The application
    of typical mitigation apparatus and techniques and installation, maintenance,
    and inspection of mitigation apparatus are addressed. Advice for determining the
    best engineering solution is offered, and general safety considerations are discussed.<<ETX>>
