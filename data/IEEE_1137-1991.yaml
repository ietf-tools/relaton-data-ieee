abstract:
- content: Provides guidance for controlling or modifying the inductive environment
    and the susceptibility of affected wire line telecommunications facilities in
    order to operate within the acceptable levels of steady-state or surge induced
    voltages of the environmental interface (probe wire) defined by IEEE Std 776-1987.
    Procedures for determining the source of the problem are given. Mitigation theory
    and philosophy are discussed, and mitigation devices are described. The application
    of typical mitigation apparatus and techniques and installation, maintenance,
    and inspection of mitigation apparatus are addressed. Advice for determining the
    best engineering solution is offered, and general safety considerations are discussed.
