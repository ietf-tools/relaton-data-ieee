abstract:
- content: This document describes haptic codecs for the data reduction of kinesthetic
    and tactile signals in response to the Call for Contributions issued by the Haptic
    Codecs Task Group for the standardization of Haptic Codecs for the Tactile Internet
    (IEEE P1918.1.1). Three types of codecs are presented in this document, including
    the no-delay kinesthetic codec (Part I), the delay-robust kinesthetic codec (Part
    II) and the tactile codec (Part III). Additionally, this document introduces handshaking
    and metadata exchange mechanisms for the exchange of the capabilities of haptic
    devices (Part IV). This document also provides additional information (in informative
    annexes) for codec implementation and evaluation, such as the reference software
    and hardware setups for kinesthetic and tactile codecs, and cross-validation results.
