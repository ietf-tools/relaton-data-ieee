abstract:
- content: Prescribes criteria that establish protection requirements for Class 1E
    power systems and equipment. It describes the purpose of and the means for obtaining
    protection from electrical and mechanical damage, or failures that can occur within
    a time period that is shorter than that required for operator action. It includes
    both design and documentation requirements. It does not include physical plant
    design requirements to protect against certain events. .
