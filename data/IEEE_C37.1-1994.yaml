abstract:
- content: Distributed multi-computer master stations and distributed remote terminal
    units (RTUs) are introduced. Submaster RTUs used in an automated distribution
    system with downstream feeder RTUs is defined. Local area networks with master
    stations are discussed. Intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) with respect to
    their interface to RTUs and master stations are defined. New surge withstand capability
    (SWC) standards and their applicability to SCADA is shown.
