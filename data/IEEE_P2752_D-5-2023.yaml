abstract:
- content: As the unique pathway of traction power reflux, the multi-point mobile
    grounding system plays a critical role in providing safer power supply for electrified
    railway. The multi-point mobile grounding system of electrified railway contains
    two types of grounding modes&#8212;working grounding and protective grounding.
    However, along with the traction power increasing, it is possible that the traction
    current discharged by the working grounding flows through the neighboring protective
    grounding points back to the vehicle bodies; then this vehicle body (VB) current
    may flee through other protective grounding points back to the rail again during
    the dynamic process of the vehicles, forming as the current reflux phenomenon.
    This VB current reflux may directly result in thermal surge in the partial part
    of train bodies, or cause the contact potential of vehicle bodies, which may interfere
    or even burn the low-voltage control systems or on-board sensors. Apart from threatening
    the on-board equipment, the uneven distribution of reflux locating at each wheel
    set of carriage may also result in the erosion of the isolated joint of rail or
    even shorten the life span of carbon brush contacting with the axles of grounding
    wheels. This guide applies to the design and requirement of grounding system for
    vehicles operation in electrified railway.
