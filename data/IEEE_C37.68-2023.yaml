abstract:
- content: Basic requirements intended to mitigate the effects of the harsh environments
    encountered by microprocessor-based controls of distribution switchgear rated
    above 1 kV up to and including 38 kV are covered. Basic requirements include the
    design, testing and application of microprocessor-based controls. Microprocessor-based
    controls covered by IEEE Std C37.68&#8482; are intended to be applied in distribution
    switchgear which is normally mounted on power poles, in wet or dry vaults, or
    in pad-mounted switchgear enclosures.
