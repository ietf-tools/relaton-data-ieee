abstract:
- content: Minimum requirements for the construction, manufacturing, purchasing, and
    application of electric submersible pump cable are presented. The cable is round
    or flat, with ethylene&#8211; propylene rubber insulation, nitrile jacket, ethylene&#8211;propylene
    diene monomer (EPDM) jacket or lead sheath, and armor. These cables are for voltages
    not exceeding 3 kV or 5 kV (phase to phase) and conductor temperatures not exceeding
    140 ºC (284 ºF) for nitrile or a maximum of 204 ºC (400 ºF) for EPDM jacket or
    lead sheath cable. Conductors, insulation, barrier (optional), assembly and jacket,
    armor, requirements for testing by the manufacturer, and cable ampacity are covered.
