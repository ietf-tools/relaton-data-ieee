abstract:
- content: Guidance on the use of outdoor power apparatus bushings is provided. The
    bushings are limited to those built in accordance with IEEE Std C57.19.00-1991.
    General information and recommendations for the application of power apparatus
    bushings, when incorporated as part of power transformers, power circuit breakers,
    and isolated-phase bus, are provided. An errata is available at http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/updates/errata/C57.98-1993.pdf
