abstract:
- content: Replaces IEEE Std 1076.6-2004. This document specifies a standard for use
    of very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL) to
    model synthesizable register-transfer level digital logic. A standard syntax and
    semantics for VHDL register-transfer level synthesis is defined. The subset of
    the VHDL language, which is synthesizable, is described, and nonsynthesizable
    VHDL constructs are identified that should be ignored or flagged as errors.
