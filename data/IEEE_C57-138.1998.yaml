abstract:
  content: General test procedures for performing routine quality control test that
    is suitable for high-volume, production line testing. Transformer connections,
    test methods, circuit configurations, and failure detection methods are addressed.
    This recommended practice covers liquid-immersed, single-and three-phase distribution
    transformers.
