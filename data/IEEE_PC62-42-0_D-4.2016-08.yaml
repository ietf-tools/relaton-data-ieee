abstract:
- content: The C62.42 guide series covers surge protective components (SPCs) used
    in power and telecom surge protective devices (SPDs) and equipment ports. This
    Overview part covers:- Protective functions both non-linear and linear- Component
    technologies and characteristics- Common circuit designs used in surge protective
    devices (SPDs) and equipment ports Information on the impulse (surge) generators
    used to test surge protective components (SPCs) Additional parts of C62.42 on
    specific SPC technologies provide details on:-Component construction-Characteristics
    and ratings-Application examples
