abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1 Q specifies the function of a MAC Relay
    with two MACs, and the protocols and procedures to support its operation. A MAC
    Relay is transparent to all frame-based media independent protocols except those
    explicitly addressed to this device. It is remotely manageable through at least
    one of its external MACs, and signals a failure of either MAC'S LAN through the
    other MAC.
