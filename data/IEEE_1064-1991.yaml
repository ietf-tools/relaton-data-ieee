abstract:
- content: A guide for developing test procedures for the functional testing of insulation
    systems used in long-life electrical equipment exposed to more than one factor
    of influence in service is presented. Included are descriptions of technical problems
    and practical possibilities that may be helpful either for guidance or as a check
    list. A sequence of action is recommended, and details of the procedures required
    for the specification of such tests are provided. The emphasis is on realistically
    modeling service aging in functional tests and making the tests as simple and
    practical as possible. Mechanisms of interaction between the factors influencing
    aging are reviewed.<<ETX>>
