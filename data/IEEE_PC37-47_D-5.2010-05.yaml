abstract:
- content: Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution Current-limiting
    fuses and disconnecting switches and associated accessories with rated voltages
    from 1 kV through 38 kV are established. All of these devices are intended for
    use on alternating current distribution systems. These include distribution current-limiting
    fuses, supports, mountings, fuse hooks, and tongs, all of the type used exclusively
    with distribution current limiting fuses used on power systems and also those
    used in enclosure packages. Current-limiting fuses for capacitor application are
    covered in C37.43.
