abstract:
- content: Standardization of cable flame propagation testing is beneficial to cable
    manufacturers,distributors, and users. Uniform procedures; consistent, repeatable
    results; and measurable testacceptance criteria are required to allow comparisons
    among competing products and to allowselection of the correct product for the
    application.
