abstract:
- content: Standardization of circuit integrity cable testing is beneficial to cable
    manufacturers, distributors, and users. Uniform procedures, consistent, repeatable
    results, and measurable test acceptance criteria are required to allow comparisons
    among competing products and to allow selection of the correct product for the
    application. In a tunnel environment, electrical cables are relied upon to operate
    life safety systems. Circuit integrity cables serve as fire resistive protection
    for electrical circuits. Circuit integrity cables are expected to protect the
    electrical circuit from the effects of severe fire conditions to allow emergency
    lighting, emergency ventilation, and other life safety circuits to remain functional
    for the required time for safe evacuation of occupants and aid first responders.
