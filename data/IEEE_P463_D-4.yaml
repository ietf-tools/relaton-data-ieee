abstract:
- content: 'This standard covers means of safeguarding personnel while operating or
    maintaining equipment located in electrolytic cell line working zones.Included
    are related requirements for equipment and electrical conductor installations.
    The general types of electrolytic cells covered include, but are not limited to,
    the dc cells used in the production of aluminum,cadmium,chlorate,chlorine,copper,fluorine,hydrogen
    peroxide, magnesium, sodium, and zinc. This standard does not cover the following:
    1)Electroplating and anodizing facilities 2)AC cells or furnaces 3)Electrothermal
    process furnaces 4)Melting or heat treating facilities 5)Arc furnaces 6)Any electrical
    equipment that is neither part of the electrolytic process equipment nor installed
    or used in the cell line working zone.'
