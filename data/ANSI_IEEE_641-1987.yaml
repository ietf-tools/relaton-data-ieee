abstract:
- content: 'This standard has ten sections: an introduction to the MNOS device and
    memory array; symbols and definitions; references that contain added detail on
    specific concepts; MNOS arrays and functional operations; MNOS array retention;
    MNOS array endurance property; reliability considerations for MNOS arrays; the
    testing methodology necessary to establish the unique properties of the MNOS array
    for both the consumer and the producer; radiation effects on MNOS arrays; and
    nonvolatile memory technology, called floating-gate.<<ETX>>'
