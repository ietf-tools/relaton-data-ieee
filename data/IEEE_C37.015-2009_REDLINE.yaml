abstract:
- content: This application guide applies to ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated
    for shunt reactor switching. The guide covers the specific cases of switching
    directly grounded shunt reactors, ungrounded shunt reactors and shunt reactors
    grounded through a neutral reactor. Directly grounded reactors are common on systems
    having a voltage of 60 kV and above, while ungrounded reactors are commonly applied
    on systems having a voltage below 60 kV. Schemes where the reactor is grounded
    through a neutral reactor are usually only applied on systems having a voltage
    of 60 kV and above. Whereas this application guide is directed towards circuit
    breakers, it is recognized and accepted that other switching devices such as high
    voltage load break switches and circuit switchers are capable of shunt reactor
    switching and this guide may be applied as appropriate.
