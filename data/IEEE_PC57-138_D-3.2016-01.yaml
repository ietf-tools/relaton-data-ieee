abstract:
- content: General test procedures for performing routine quality control test that
    is suitable for high volume, production line testing. Transformer connections,
    test methods, circuit configurations and failure detection methods are addressed.
    This recommended practice covers liquid-immersed, single-and three-phase distribution
    transformers.
