abstract:
- content: 'The carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) media
    access method is the means by which two or more stations share a common bus transmission
    medium. This is a comprehensive standard for local area networks employing CSMA/CD
    as the access method. This standard encompasses several media types and techniques
    for signal rates from 1 Mb/s to 20 Mb/s. IEEE Std 802.3-1985 provides the necessary
    specifications and related parameter values for a 10 Mb/s baseband implementation.
    In order to achieve greater clarity and flexibility, this document is organized
    along architectural lines, i.e. emphasizing the logical divisions of the system
    and how they fit together. It describes the large-scale separation of the system
    into two parts: the media access control (MAC) sublayer of the data link layer,
    and the physical layer. These layers correspond closely to the lowest layers of
    the ISO Model for Open System Interconnection (OSI). The LLC sublayer and the
    MAC sublayer together encompass the functions intended for the data link layer
    as defined in the OSI model.<<ETX>>'
