abstract:
- content: The purpose of this guide is to provide general recommendations for consideration
    when designing new overhead transmission lines that will be operated at high temperatures.
    It may also evaluate existing transmission lines for operation at higher temperatures.
    Although this guide is intended for overhead transmission lines, most of the discussion
    will also be applicable to distribution lines.
