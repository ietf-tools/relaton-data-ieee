abstract:
- content: The Criteria for Nuclear Power Generating Station Protection Systems, IEEE
    Std 279-1971, establish minimum requirements for the safety-related functional
    performance and reliability of the protection system for stationary, land-based
    nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power generation. These requirements
    include, but are not limited to,the capability for testing the protection system.
    In order to develop tests and establish test procedures, an expansion and interpretation
    of the test capabilities specified in IEEE Std 279-1971 is necessary.
