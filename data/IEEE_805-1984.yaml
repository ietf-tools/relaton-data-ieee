abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a single source of nuclear power plant
    system descriptions that, along with related recommended practices concerning
    unique identification principles and definitions, component function identifiers,
    and implementation instructions, provide a basis for uniquely identifying systems,
    structures, and components of light water nuclear power plant projects (electric
    power generating stations) and related facilities. The system descriptions concentrate
    on system function and include such internal details as are necessary to clearly
    support the system function description. They are not intended to serve as design
    input. Fossil, hydro, and other types of power plants are not included. This standard
    is part of a series of recommended practices, entitled the Energy Industry Identification
    System (EIIS), the purpose of which is to present a common language of communication
    that will permit a user to correlate a system, structure, or component with that
    of another organization for the purposes of reporting, comparison, or general
    communication. A significant feature of this concept is that the unique identification
    code identifies the function at the component level and not the hardware itself.
