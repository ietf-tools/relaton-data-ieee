abstract:
- content: Information to assist users of gaskets in evaluating gasket measurement
    techniques to determine which exhibit the properties critical to the intended
    application, to highlight limitations and sources of error of the competing measurement
    techniques, and to provide a basis for comparing the techniques is provided in
    this guide. Emphasis is placed on those measurement techniques that have been
    adopted through incorporation into standards, both commercial and military, or
    that have been used extensively.
