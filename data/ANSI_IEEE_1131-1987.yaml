abstract:
- content: This standard establishes fixed dimensions for end-caps in the interests
    of interchangeability of cryostats from various manufacturers. Seven standard
    diameters and five minimum lengths are specified for the cylindrical surface separating
    the environment from the vacuum enclosure around the Ge crystal.<<ETX>>
