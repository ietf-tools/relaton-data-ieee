abstract:
- content: This standard is a collaborative effort to improve and standardize the
    1.0.3 version Experience Application Programming Interface (xAPI) specification.
    This Standard describes a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data model format
    and a Representational State Transfer (RESTful) Web Service Application Programming
    Interface (API) for communication between Activities experienced by an individual,
    group, or other entity and a Learning Record Store (LRS). The LRS is a system
    that exposes the RESTful Web Service API for the purpose of tracking and accessing
    experiential data, especially in learning and human performance.
