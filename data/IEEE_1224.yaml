abstract:
  content: The Portable Applications Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society
    carried out a series of analyses of various problems encountered by users of IEEE
    Std 1224-1993, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Open Systems Interconnection
    (OSI) Abstract Data Manipulation - Application Program Interface (API); IEEE Std
    1327-1993, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Open Systems Interconnection
    (OSI) Abstract Data Manipulation C Language Interfaces - Binding for Application
    Program Interface (API); and IEEE Std 1224.1-1993, IEEE Standard for Information
    Technology - X.400-Based Electronic Messaging - Application Program Interface
    (API). The results of its deliberations are presented in this document. The intent
    is to give the 1224 community reasonable ways of interpreting unclear portions
    of these standards.
