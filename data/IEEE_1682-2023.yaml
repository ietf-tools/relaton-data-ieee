abstract:
- content: The general requirements, directions, and methods for qualifying fiber
    optic cables, connections, and optical fiber splices for use in safety systems
    of nuclear power generating stations, including fuel reprocessing stations and
    other related installations, are provided in this standard. Cables, optical fibers,
    and splices within or integral to other devices (e.g., sensors, instruments, panels,
    etc.) shall be qualified using the requirements in the applicable device standard
    or IEC/IEEE 60780- 323:2016, as appropriate. However, the requirements of this
    standard may be applied to the fiber optic cable and interfaces within these devices.
