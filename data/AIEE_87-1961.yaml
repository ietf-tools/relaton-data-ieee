abstract:
- content: The provisions of this Recommended Practice apply to the construction and
    application of controllers for alternating-current motors in the medium-voltage
    classification (601 to 5,000 volts). Although many of the specifications herein
    have been influenced by the conditions peculiar to the processing areas of the
    industries, it is probable that they may be applied to all purchases of controllers
    for a given company in order to promote uniformity. They are intended as minimum
    requirements, and should be supplemented where special needs exist.
