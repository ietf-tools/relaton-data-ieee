abstract:
- content: This standard establishes methods for the calibration and use of gas proportional
    counters with and without active guard detectors. This standard also establishes
    methods for measuring the alpha and beta counting plateau, crosstalk factors,
    background, alpha and beta efficiency from prepared standards, correction factors
    for samples whose self-attenuation or mass differs from that of the standard,
    and calculation of the sample activities together with their random and total
    uncertainties. Correction for pulse pileup due to high count rate is also discussed.
    Although many principles articulated in this standard apply to the counting of
    radionuclides emitting a maximum beta energy below 100 keV as well, the counting
    of these low-energy beta emitters requires a higher degree of attention to detail
    in sample preparation, instrument calibration, and measurement correction factors
    than addressed in this standard. Therefore, this standard is intended for measuring
    radionuclides with maximum beta energies above 100 keV.
