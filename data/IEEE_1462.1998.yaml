abstract:
  content: 'This standard defines a process for evaluating and selecting a Computer
    Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool for a software development or maintenance
    activity. The standard addresses the evaluation and selection of tools supporting
    software engineering processes including: project management processes, development
    processes, and integral processes. Project purpose: The primary users of ISO/IEC
    14402 are organizations that intend to adopt CASE tools to support their software
    life cycle processes. CASE tool suppliers may also use 14402 to describe the characteristics
    of their CASE tools.'
