abstract:
- content: High voltage reactor generates sound during operation due to vibration
    with the action of electrical and mechanical stress. These sound signals contain
    rich state information about the reactor. Therefore, the measurement and research
    into reactor sound signals can aid the evaluation of equipment status. The development
    of acoustic imaging technology also provides a solid technical foundation for
    locating abnormal noise in reactors. Acoustic imaging technology allows researchers
    to obtain the distribution of the sound field of reactor with a microphone array.
    Combined with knowledge of the reactor structure and operating status, this technology
    can effectively help researchers determine the position of a sound signal and
    diagnose the status of reactors. The characteristics of acoustic imaging technology
    include non-contact measurement, simple operation, and flexible arrangement. The
    measured results are important for diagnosing reactor status and identifying sound
    sources. To guide and provide instructions for the testing of on-site acoustic
    imaging for reactors, this guide is formulated to specify the test methods, provide
    the basic requirements and describe the test instruments, procedures, test data
    analysis methods, and data records, while providing guidance for the testing of
    acoustic imaging for reactor.
