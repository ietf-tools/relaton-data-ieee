abstract:
- content: An alternative physical layer (PHY) and a modified medium access control
    (MAC) layeris defined in this amendment.Two PHY modes have been defined that enable
    data rates up to 100 Gb/s using the 60 GHz band. MIMO and aggregation methods
    have been defined to increase the maximum achievable communication speeds. Stack
    acknowledgment has been defined to improve the medium access control (MAC) efficiency
    when used in a point-to-point (P2P) topology between two devices.
