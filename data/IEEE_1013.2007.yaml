abstract:
- content: A method for determining the energy-capacity requirements (sizing) of both
    vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries used in terrestrial stand-alone
    photovoltaic (PV) systems is described. Sizing batteries for hybrid or grid-connected
    PV systems is beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Installation, maintenance,
    safety, testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid
    are beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Recommended practices for the
    remainder of the electrical systems associated with PV installations are also
    beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
