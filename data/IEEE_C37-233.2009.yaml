abstract:
- content: Test approaches and procedures for the components and the overall protection
    and control system functions are presented. Test of equipment in the system protection
    scheme, associated communications equipment, auxiliary power supplies, and the
    control of power apparatus are addressed. Much of the testing emphasizes a bottom-up
    approach, in which the basic behavior of scheme components are verified first,
    followed by testing of interconnected components in a function-oriented assembly.

- content: This guide covers suggested test requirements for power system protection
    scheme testing, system application tests, the scope and level of tests based on
    the application, and benefits of the overall protective schemes testing. This
    guide encompasses overall system testing procedures (generators, line, line reactors,
    transformer, capacitors, special protection schemes, end-to-end testing, distributed
    application within substation, etc.) and data collection requirements, as well
    as the test procedure definitions. This guide describes the methods, extent, and
    types of system tests for protection applications at various voltage levels. Control
    functions inherent to the protective systems are included. Importance of line
    testing, indirect trip applications, open/closed-loop tests, and dynamic/nonlinear
    tests are also covered.
