abstract:
- content: The application of the single-failure criterion to the electrical power,
    instrumentaion, and control portions of nuclear power generating station safety
    systems is covered. Conformance with the requirements of IEEE Std 603-1991 and
    the single-failure criterion as stated in that document is established. Interpretation
    and guidance in the application of the single-failure criterion, a discussion
    of the failures, and an acceptable method of single-failure analysis are presented.
