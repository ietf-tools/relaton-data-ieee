abstract:
- content: This standard specifies radio technology independent methods for network-based
    coexistence among dissimilar or independently operated networks of unlicensed
    devices and dissimilar unlicensed devices. The standard is defined for geo-location
    capable devices operating under general authorization such as TV band White Spaces,
    the 5 GHz license-exempt bands and the general authorized access the 3.5 GHz bands.
