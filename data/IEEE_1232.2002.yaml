abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEC/IEEE 62243-2005 (SH/SS95359) AI-ESTATE is a set of specifications
    for data interchange and for standard services forthe test and diagnostic environment.
    The purpose of AI-ESTATE is to standardize interfaces between functional elements
    of an intelligent diagnostic reasoner and representations of diagnostic knowledge
    and data for use by such diagnostic reasoners. Formal information models are defined
    to form the basis for a format to facilitate exchange of persistent diagnostic
    information between two reasoners, and also to provide a formal typing system
    for diagnostic services. This standard thendefines the services to manipulate
    diagnostic information and to control a diagnostic reasoner.
