abstract:
- content: Environmental testing requirements are defined for communications networkingdevices
    to be installed in transmission and distribution facilities. This standard establishes
    acommon reproducible basis for designing and evaluating devices utilizing radio
    frequency (RF) upto 6 GHz, power line communications, and broadband over power
    line (BPL) technologies. It alsorequires immunity to five IEC electromagnetic
    compatibility standards for which there are no IEEEequivalent standards. This
    standard is an extension to IEEE Std 1613(tm)-2009 and IEEE Std1613a(tm)-2011.
