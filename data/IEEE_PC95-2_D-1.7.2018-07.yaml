abstract:
- content: Symbols to inform people about the presence of potentially hazardous levels
    of radiofrequency energy or the presence of contact current hazards in the frequency
    range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz are specified in this standard. Guidance is given about
    how these symbols should be used on warning signs and labels. (The PDF of this
    standards is available at no cost. "IEEE Get Program" grants public access to
    view and download individual PDFs of select standards at no charge. Visit https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=82
