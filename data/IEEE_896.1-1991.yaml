abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Std 896.1-1991 provides a set of tools with which to implement a
    Futurebus+architecture with performance and cost scalability over time, for multiple
    generations of single- and multiple-bus multiprocessor systems. Although this
    specification is principally intended for 64-bit address and data operation, a
    fully compatible 32-bit subset is provided, along with compatible extensions to
    support 128- and 256-bit data highways. Allocation of bus bandwidth to competing
    modules is provided by either a fast centralized arbiter, or a fully distributed,
    one or two pass, parallel contention arbiter. Bus allocation rules are provided
    to suit the needs of both real-time (priority based) and fairness (equal opportunity
    access based) configurations. Transmission of data over the multiplexed address/data
    highway is governed by one of two intercompatible transmission methods: (1) a
    technology-independent, compelled-protocol, supporting broadcast, broadcall, and
    transfer intervention (the minimum requirement for all Futurebus+systems), and
    (2) a configurable transfer-rate, source-synchronized protocol supporting only
    block transfers and source-synchronized broadcast for systems requiring the highest
    possible performance.'
