abstract:
- content: This standard defines the Streaming Telemetry Transport Protocol, STTP.
    This protocol is initially designed for streaming power system data over Internet
    protocol (IP) communication systems. It is focused on streaming real-time measurements
    but can be used with any type of continuously flowing data. It features built-in
    security and lossless data compression options for efficient transport. It specifies
    data types and transport control methods using a publish-subscribe architecture
    for controlled signal-level data access. It uses standard security and transport
    options, so it is easy to maintain and update. It is highly configurable for time
    precision, compression level, and packet sizes to optimize the stream within data
    and transport limitations. It has been proven and refined in several demonstration
    projects and production environments.
