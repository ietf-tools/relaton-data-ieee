abstract:
- content: This guide was developed to assist individuals, organizations, and suppliers
    with the application of motors in Class I, Division 2 locations, where flammable
    gases and vapors may occasionally be present. Three-phase and single-phase ac
    synchronous and induction electric motors, fractional through very large sizes,
    are covered in this guide. Primary emphasis is on the use of general-purpose enclosures
    and precautions against excessive surface temperatures and sparking of rotor bars
    and enclosure joints. Results of motor surface temperature tests and calculations
    performed by Working Group Member companies are documented in the guide. Guidance
    is included for maintaining the life-cycle integrity of motors in Class I, Division
    2 locations. Existing codes and standards contain cautionary notes for general-purpose
    motor applications in Class I, Division 2 areas. Industry experience and established
    practices are documented for the application of general-purpose motors in Class
    I, Division 2 locations and guidance is given for applying motors in these locations.
    This guide is not a specification and is not intended for use as a specification
    for purchasing motors installed in Division 2 locations.
