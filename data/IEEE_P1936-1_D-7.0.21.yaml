abstract:
  content: A framework for support of drone applications is established in this standard.
    It specifies typical drone application classes and application scenarios and the
    required application execution environments. The general facility requirements
    of drone application are listed, including flight platform, flight control system,
    ground control station, payload, control link and data link, takeoff and landing
    system, etc. The drone safety and management requirements include airworthiness,
    airspace, and air traffic requirements, qualification of operators, qualification
    of personnel, insurance, confidentiality and others. The general operation process
    is detailed. The operation results stipulate the operation record and operation
    report, including data classification, data collection and processing, data record
    and analysis and data reference format.
