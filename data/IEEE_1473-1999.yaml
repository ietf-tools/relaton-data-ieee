abstract:
- content: Communications protocols to be used for intercar and intracar serial data
    communica-tions between subsystems aboard passenger trains are defined by this
    standard. Minimum accept-able parameters for a network that can simultaneously
    handle monitoring and control traffic from multiple systems are set forth. While
    the network is not vital, it is intended to be capable of carrying vital messages.
