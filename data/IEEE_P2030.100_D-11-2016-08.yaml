abstract:
- content: This recommended practice outlines the steps and procedures a user should
    undertake to implement an IEC 61850 substation in both a single and multi-vendor
    equipment environment. The recommended practice addresses intelligent electronic
    device (IED) specification, procurement, configuration, and documentation to develop
    a general design philosophy that transforms the IEC 61850 standard using this
    as a practical working implementation guide. This recommended practice gives a
    general overview of an IEC 61850 implementation. Future work may develop more
    detail behind the topics presented herein.
