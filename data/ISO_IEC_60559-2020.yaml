abstract:
- content: This international standard specifies interchange and arithmetic formats
    and methods for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming
    environments. This standard specifies exception conditions and their default handling.
    An implementation of a floating-point system conforming to this standard may be
    realized entirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in any combination of
    software and hardware. For operations specified in the normative part of this
    standard, numerical results and exceptions are uniquely determined by the values
    of the input data, sequence of operations, and destination formats, all under
    user control.
