abstract:
- content: In conclusion, the application of alternating-current machines requires
    a working knowledge of the performance characteristics of the generator-regulator
    combination. Special emphasis should be placed on machine ratings, short-circuit,
    overvoltage, underspeed and fault power characteristics. Aid in understanding
    these characteristics is received by a study of synchronous machine analysis,
    but the detailed investigations performed by the cooperstive effort of the machine
    and regulator designers relieve the system designer of much of this work by providing
    characteristics in an immediately usable form.
