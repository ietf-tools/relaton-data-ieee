abstract:
- content: A real-time operating system (RTOS) called &#956;T-Kernel for small-scale
    embedded systems such as systems with a single chip microcomputer including 16-bit
    CPUs, systems with a small amount of ROM/RAM, and systems without a memory management
    unit (MMU) are specified in this standard.
