abstract:
- content: 'The transient overvoltages or surge events that are described and discussed
    in this guide are those that originate outside of a building or facility and impinge
    on a power distribution system through the service entrance conductors. Transient
    overvoltages or surge events that originate from equipment within a specific facility
    are not within the scope of this document. This guide applies to: Surge Protective
    Devices (SPDs) that are manufactured for connections to 50 or 60Hz ac power circuits
    that are rated between 100Vac - 1000Vac. SPDs that are specifically identified,
    labeled, or listed for connections on the load side of the service entrance main
    overcurrent protective device. SPDs manufactured for use in an association with
    electrical power distribution equipment such as load centers, motor control centers,
    panelboards, switchboards, switchgear, and end-use equipment installed in commercial
    and industrial facilities. SPDs that contain at least one nonlinear component
    for either diverting surge currents or dissipating surge energy, or both. Examples
    of such nonlinear components are metal oxide varistors, silicon avalanche diodes,
    spark gap tubes, or thyristors. This guide does not cover : SPDs identified, labeled,
    or tested as a Secondary Surge Arrester intended for connections on the line side
    of the service entrance main overcurrent protective device. SPDs associated with
    retail and consumer appliances and components for residential use. This guide
    does not specify or set limits on insulation levels of any components associated
    with power distribution systems or end use equipment. Individual SPD component
    specifications associated with any specific manufacturer of surge protection products.
    Ferroresonators, motor- generators, uninterruptible power supplies, and filters
    containing only inductive or capacitive components are not considered SPDs in
    the guide.'
