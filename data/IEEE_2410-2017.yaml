abstract:
- content: Identity assertion, role gathering, multilevel access control, assurance,
    and auditing are provided by the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS). The
    BOPS implementation includes software running on a client device, a trusted BOPS
    server, and an intrusion detection system. The BOPS implementation allows pluggable
    components to replace existing components functionality, accepting integration
    into current operating environments in a short period of time. The BOPS implementation
    provides continuous protection to the resources and assurance of the placement
    and viability of adjudication and other key features. Accountability is the mechanism
    that proves a service-level guarantee of security. The BOPS implementation allows
    the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface.
    The BOPS implementation need not know whether the underlying system is a relational
    database management system or a search engine. The BOPS implementation functionality
    offers a point-and-cut mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production
    systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is language
    neutral, allowing Representational State Transfer (REST), JavaScript Object Notation
    (JSON), and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide
    the communication interface. The architecture is built on the servlet specification,
    open SSLs, Java, JSON, REST, and an open persistent store. All tools adhere to
    open standards, allowing maximum interoperability.
