abstract:
- content: This Standard describes a data model to support the interchange of data
    elements and their values between a content object and a runtime service (RTS).
    It is based on a current industry practice called "computer managed instruction"
    (CMI). The work on which this Standard is based was developed to support a client/server
    environment in which a learning technology system, generically called a learning
    management system (LMS), delivers digital content, called content objects, to
    learners. The data model supports learner data and preferences, interactions,
    objectives, content-object entry, exit, and status information, time parameters,
    and scores. &lt;br&#x003E; Second Printing 24 June 2010. Errata incorporated 24
