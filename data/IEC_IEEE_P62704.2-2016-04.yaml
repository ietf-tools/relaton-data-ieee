abstract:
- content: This standard describes the concepts, techniques, vehicle models, validation
    procedures, uncertainties and limitations of the finite-difference time-domain
    technique (FDTD) when used for determining the spatial-peak specific absorption
    rate (SAR) in standardized human anatomical models exposed to vehicle mounted
    antennas. Recommended vehicle models and general benchmark data for these models
    are provided. Antenna locations, operating configurations, exposure conditions
    and positions of persons exposed to the vehicle mounted antennas are defined.
    Intended users of this practice are (but are not be limited to) wireless communication
    devices manufacturers, service providers for wireless communication that are required
    to certify that their products comply with the applicable SAR limits and government
    agencies. Specific SAR limit values (basic restrictions) are not included since
    these are found in other documents, e.g., IEEE C95.1-2005 and IEEE C95.1a-2010.
