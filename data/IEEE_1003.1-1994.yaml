abstract:
- content: 'The Portable Applications Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society
    carried out a series of analyses of various problems encountered by users of IEEE
    Std 1003.1 -1990, IEEE Standard for Information Technology- Portable Operating
    System Interface (POSIX)- Part 1: System Application Program Interface (API) and
    IEEE Std 2003.1 -1992, IEEE Standard for Information Technology- Test Methods
    for Measuring Conformance to POSIX- Part 1: System Interfaces. The results of
    its deliberations are presented in this document. The intent is to give the POSIX
    community reasonable ways of interpreting unclear portions of these standards.'
