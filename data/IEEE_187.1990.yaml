abstract:
  content: 'Superseded by 187-2003. IEEE Standard on Radio Receivers: Open Field Method
    of Measurement of Spurious Radiation from FM and Television Broadcast Receivers,
    describes the potential sources of spurious radiation from frequency modulation
    and television broadcast receivers and sets up methods of measurement. This standard
    is not intended to apply to equipment other than FM and television broadcast receivers.'
