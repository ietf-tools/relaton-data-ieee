abstract:
- content: IEC 61000-4-15:2010 is adopted by this standard. IEC 61000-4-15:2010 gives
    a functional and design specification for flicker measuring apparatus intended
    to indicate the correct flicker perception level for all practical voltage fluctuation
    waveforms. Information is presented to enable such an instrument to be constructed.
    A method is given for the evaluation of flicker severity on the basis of the output
    of flickermeters complying with this standard. The object of IEC 61000-4-15:2010
    is to provide basic information for the design and the instrumentation of an analogue
    or digital flicker measuring apparatus. It does not give tolerance limit values
    of flicker severity.
