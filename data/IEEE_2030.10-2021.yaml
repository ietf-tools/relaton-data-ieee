abstract:
- content: The design and operation of a dc microgrid for rural or remote applications
    based on extra low voltage dc (ELVDC) to reduce cost and simplify stability are
    discussed in this standard. Such microgrids are typically operated without connecting
    to a nation’s electric power system.
