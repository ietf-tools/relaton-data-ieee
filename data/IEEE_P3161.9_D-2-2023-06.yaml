abstract:
- content: Specified in this standard are the aspects of communication process, general
    requirements, and data format of interfaces for multiple data streams and control
    commands involved in digital retina systems (DRSs). It provides protocol and interface
    specifications for the design, development, and manufacturing of devices or platforms
    to enable connections and interactions among heterogeneous devices.
