abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the aspects of communication process, general requirements
    and data format of interfaces for multiple data streams and control commands involved
    in the digital retina systems (DRS). It provides protocol and interface specifications
    for the design, development and manufacturing of devices or platforms, to enable
    connections and interactions among heterogeneous devices.
