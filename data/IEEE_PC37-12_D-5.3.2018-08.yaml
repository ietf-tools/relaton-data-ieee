abstract:
- content: Specifications that apply to all indoor and outdoor types of ac high-voltage
    circuit breakers rated above 1000 volts are covered in this document. This document
    is issued only as a guide for use in compiling specifications for ac high-voltage
    circuit breakers. The imperative mode of the language is illustrative of that
    used in specifications.
