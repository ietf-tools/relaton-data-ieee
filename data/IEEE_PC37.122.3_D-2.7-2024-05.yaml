abstract:
- content: Significant aspects of handling SF^6 gas used in electric power equipment
    such as gas recovery, reclamation, recycling in order to keep the gas permanently
    in a closed cycle and aid to prevent any deliberate release in environment are
    described. The purpose of this guide is to provide state-of-the-art technologies
    and procedures to reduce SF6 gas emission to a minimum functional level for the
    electric power equipment to preserve the environment. This guide will include
    all the aspects for consideration during commissioning and recommissioning, topping
    up, refilling, checking the gas quality at site, sampling and shipment for off-site
    gas analysis, and recovering and reclaiming during normal operation and at the
    end of the life of power equipment while dismantling. This guide also presents
    the state-of-the art tools and measuring devices including the necessary personnel
    protective equipment. The basis for the preparation of this guide is CIGRE Brochure
    No. 276, Guide for preparation of customized “Practical SF6 handling instructions,”
    August 2005 edition, developed by the Study Committee B3, Task Force B3.02.01.
