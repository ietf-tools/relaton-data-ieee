abstract:
- content: The surging needs for the Internet of Things (IoT) are dramatically shifting
    the network structure and challenging the traditional perimeter security paradigm.
    To establish secure and trustworthy interoperability among billions of heterogeneous
    interconnected devices, there is a need for standards defining a common framework.
    This standard defines a blockchain-based Zero-Trust access control framework and
    gives a typical implementation model and deployment variations, addressing general
    security and trust in IoT applications with the inspiration of the emerging Zero-Trust
    paradigm and blockchain technology. The leverage of blockchain and Zero-Trust
    could provide reliable interactions among people, things, and applications in
    the presence of failures and attacks, and improve an IoT system's overall information
    technology security posture.
