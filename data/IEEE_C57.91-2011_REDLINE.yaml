abstract:
- content: This guide provides recommendations for loading mineral-oil-immersed transformers
    and step-voltage regulators with insulation systems rated for a 65 &#176;C average
    winding temperature rise at rated load. This guide applies to transformers manufactured
    in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.001 and tested in accordance with IEEE Std
    C57.12.90, and step-voltage regulators manufactured and tested in accordance with
    IEEE Std C57.15. Because a substantial population of transformers and step-voltage
    regulators with insulation systems rated for 55 &#176;C average winding temperature
    rise at rated load are still in service, recommendations that are specific to
    this equipment are also included.
