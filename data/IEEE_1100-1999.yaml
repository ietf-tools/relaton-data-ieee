abstract:
- content: 'Superseded by IEEE Std 1100-2005 Abstract: Recommended design, installation,
    and maintenance practices for electrical powerand grounding (including both power-
    related and signal-related noise control) of sensitive elec-tronic processing
    equipment used in commercial and industrial applications are presented. Themain
    objective is to provide a consensus of recommended practices in an area where
    conflict-ing information and confusion, stemming primarily from different viewpoints
    of the sameproblem, have dominated. Practices herein address electronic equipment
    performance issueswhile maintaining a safe installation. A brief description is
    given of the nature of power qualityproblems, possible solutions, and the resources
    available for assistance in dealing with prob-lems. Fundamental concepts are reviewed.
    Instrumentation and procedures for conducting asurvey of the power distribution
    system are described. Site surveys and site power analysesare considered. Case
    histories are given to illustrate typical problems.'
