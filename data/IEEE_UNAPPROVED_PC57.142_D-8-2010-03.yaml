abstract:
- content: This guide addresses the performance of transformers in the presence of
    oscillatory transients. Oscillatory transients are typically produced by the interaction
    of the switching device, transformer, load, and system. This Guide describes operating
    conditions that may produce oscillatory switching transient voltages damaging
    to the transformer insulation system. It discusses the electrical characteristics
    of the source, switching device, transformer, load and the nature of their transient
    interaction. It discusses several mitigation methods. Two generic examples are
    included. This Guide focuses on mechanical switching 6 devices and does not address
    semiconductor switching devices.
