abstract:
- content: Application of IEEE Std 1547-2018 to the interconnection of energy storage
    distributed energy resources (ES DER) to electric power systems (EPSs) is described
    in this guide. Along with examples of such interconnection, guidance on prudent
    and technically sound approaches to these interconnections is also given. The
    guide’s scope includes ES DER that are capable of exporting active power to an
    EPS. The guide also considers energy storage-related topics that are not currently
    addressed or fully covered in IEEE Std 1547-2018 and sets a basis for future development
    of industry best practices for ES DER-specific interconnection requirements that
    could be considered in future revisions of IEEE Std 1547.
