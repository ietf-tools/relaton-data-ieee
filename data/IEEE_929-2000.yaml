abstract:
- content: This recommended practice contains guidance regarding equipment and functions
    necessary to ensure compatible operation of photovoltaic (PV) systems that are
    connected in parallel with the electric utility. This includes factors relating
    to personnel safety, equipment protection, power quality, and utility system operation.
    This recommended practice also contains information regarding islanding of PV
    systems when the utility is not connected to control voltage and frequency, as
    well as techniques to avoid islanding of distributed resources.
