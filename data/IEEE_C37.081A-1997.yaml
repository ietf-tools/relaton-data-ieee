abstract:
- content: The transient recovery voltage needs to be modified when interrupting asymmetrical
    currents. The voltage rate R, the peak voltage E2 and the rate of change of current
    di/dt all change with the asymmetrical current zero. Guidance is provided on how
    to make these corrections when compared to the symmetrical case.
