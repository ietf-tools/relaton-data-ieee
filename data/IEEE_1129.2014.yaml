abstract:
- content: The guidelines for online monitoring of large synchronous generators are
    described in this guide. High-level discussions of each of the proposed monitoring
    methods, and recommended threshold values, whenever there is a general agreement
    on those values, are included in this standard. Instrumentation that is clearly
    understood to belong to the protection scheme of the generator (e.g., differential
    protection) is not covered by this guide.
