abstract:
- content: The objective of this document is to specify the assessment methods to
    evaluate compliance of stationary and dynamic wireless power transfer (WPT) systems
    with electromagnetic human exposure guidelines (specific absorption rate (SAR),
    internal electric fields, or current density including contact currents). The
    frequency range covered by this document is from 1 kHz to 30 MHz. This version
    of the standard focuses on exposures from inductive WPT systems. Future versions
    will consider extended guidance for assessments of exposure from capacitive WPT
    systems.
