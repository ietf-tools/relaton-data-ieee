abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to describe a practical method for measuring
    the transmission characteristics of a telephone set by means of objective measurements
    on a test connection. The test results thus obtained may be used as a means of
    evaluating or specifying the transmission performance of a telephone set on a
    standardized basis. The basic accuracy and reproducibility of measurements made
    in accordance with this standard will depend primarily upon the accuracy of the
    test equipment used, the care with which the measurements are conducted, and the
    inherent stability of the telephone set or transducers under test, or both. Where
    a given set of measurements is repeated in the same laboratory and by the same
    operator, a relatively high degree of reproducibility should normally be obtained.
    However, when comparing measurements made by different laboratories, allowances
    should be made for the influencing factors mentioned above.
