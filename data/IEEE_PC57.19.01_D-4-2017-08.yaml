abstract:
- content: Electrical, dimensional, and related requirements for power transformer
    and reactor bushings that have basic impulse insulation levels (BILs) of 150 kV
    and above are covered. Specific values for dimensional and related requirements
    that are to be interpreted, measured, or tested, in accordance with IEEE Std C57.19.00(TM),
    are provided.
