abstract:
- content: 'The IEEE 1680 family of standards defines environmental performance criteria
    for electronic products. The scope of this document is to provide guidelines and
    implementation procedures for the standards included in the IEEE 1680 family of
    standards. Each Standard in the IEEE 1680 family of standards shall address criteria
    for a specific product or group of products in at least the following eight categories
    of environmental performance: reduction or elimination of environmentally sensitive
    materials, materials selection, design for end of life, life cycle extension,
    energy conservation, end of life management, corporate performance and packaging.'
