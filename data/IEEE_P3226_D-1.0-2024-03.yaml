abstract:
- content: This standard defines a trusted data circulation platform based on blockchain
    and distributed ledger technologies. The system overview of trusted data circulation
    platform is defined including underlying computation engine layer, blockchain
    and DLT core function layer, trusted data circulation layer, and interface layer.
    The functional modules, data circulation processes, technical and security requirements
    are specified. This standard includes recommendations for controlling the allowable
    purposes and amount of data utilization, and for data privacy and resistance to
    tampering during the relevant data operations.
