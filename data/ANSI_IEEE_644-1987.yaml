abstract:
- content: Uniform procedures for the measurement of power frequency electric and
    magnetic fields from alternating current (AC) overhead power lines and for the
    calibration of the meters used in these measurements are established. The procedures
    apply to the measurement of electric and magnetic fields close to ground level.
    The procedures can also be tentatively applied (with limitations, as specified
    in the standard) to electric fields near an energized conductor or structure.
