abstract:
- content: This standard applies to the measurement of bulk properties of high-purity
    germanium as they relate to fabrication and performance of germanium detectors
    for gamma rays and x rays. Such germanium is monocrystalline and has a net concentration
    of fewer than 1011 electrically active impurity center per cm3, usually on the
    order of 1010 cm-3.
