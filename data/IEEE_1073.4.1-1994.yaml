abstract:
- content: A physical interface for the interconnection of computers and medical devices
    in the 1073 family of standards is defined. This interface is intended to be highly
    robust in an environment where devices are frequently connected to and disconnected
    from the network. The physical and electrical characteristics of the connector
    and signals necessary to exchange digital information between cable-connected
    medical devices and host computer systems are specified.<<ETX>>
