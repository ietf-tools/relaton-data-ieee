abstract:
- content: Direct-current (dc) charging is a method of charging that facilitates rapid
    energy transfer from the electric grid to plug-in vehicles. This method of charging
    allows significantly more current to be drawn by the vehicle versus lower rated
    alternating-current (ac) systems. A combination of vehicles that can accept high-current
    dc charge and the dc supply equipment that provides it has led to the use of terminology
    such as “fast charging,” “fast charger,” “dc charger,” “quick charger,” etc. DC
    charging and ac charging vary by the location at which ac current is converted
    to dc current. For typical dc charging, the current is converted at the off-board
    charger, which is separate from the vehicle. For ac charging, the current is converted
    inside the vehicle, by means of an on-board charger. The location of the ac to
    dc conversion equipment, or converter, shapes the complexity of the equipment
    design. Regarding ac charging, as previously mentioned, the conversion is on board
    the vehicle. This allows the original equipment maker (OEM) designed systems to
    control the charging operation in its entirety. The on-board charger (converter)
    and battery controller solution is under direct control of the vehicle manufacturer.
    For dc charging, an entirely new challenge exists for OEMs. The dc charger is
    now external to the vehicle and requires the vehicle engineers to control an external
    power device. For the reason of necessary interoperability, standards such as
    IEEE Std 2030.1.1 are provided to assist developers.
