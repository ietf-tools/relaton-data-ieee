abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 532-2007. This guide covers properties of commonly
    used jackets as well as selection and testing of jackets. It is written for those
    responsible for optimizing cable designs. The purpose is to present a reasonably
    complete picture of the role of jackets so that the subject can be approached
    in an orderly and organized manner. An effort has been made to avoid the highly
    technical language and theory commonly used by electrical engineers and chemists
    to discuss the more detailed application of jackets.
