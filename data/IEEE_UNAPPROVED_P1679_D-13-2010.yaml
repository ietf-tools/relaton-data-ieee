abstract:
- content: This document covers recommended information for an objective evaluation
    of an emerging energy storage device or system by a potential user for any stationary
    application. Energy storage technologies are those that provide a means for the
    reversible storage of electrical energy, i.e. the device receives electrical energy
    and is able to discharge electrical energy at a later time. The storage medium
    may be electrochemical (e.g. batteries), kinetic (e.g. flywheels), electrostatic
    (e.g. electric double-layer capacitors), thermal, or some other medium. Devices
    recharged by non-electrical means, such as fuel cells, are beyond the scope of
    this document.
