abstract:
- content: This International Standard establishes a common framework for software
    life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by
    the software industry. It applies to the acquisition of systems and software products
    and services, to the supply, development, operation, maintenance, and disposal
    of software products and the software portion of a system, whether performed internally
    or externally to an organization. Those aspects of system definition needed to
    provide the context for software products and services are included. Software
    includes the software portion of firmware. This revision integrates ISO/IEC 12207:1995
    with its two amendments and was coordinated with the parallel revision of ISO/I
    EC 15288:2002 (System life cycle processes) to align structure, terms, and corresponding
    organizational and project processes. This standard may be used stand alone or
    jointly with ISO/IEC 15288, and supplies a process reference model that supports
    process capability assessment in accordance with ISO/IEC 15504-2 (Process assessment).
    An annex provides support for IEEE users and describes relationships of this International
    Standard to IEEE standards.
