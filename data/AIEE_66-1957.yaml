abstract:
- content: This guide presents general recommendations for determining, by approximate
    methods from nameplate data and by more exact methods from design data, the short-circuit
    characteristics of direct-current motors and generators. Both methods are applicable
    to general purpose, general industrial mill motors, and special purpose direct-current
    machines. This includes constant-speed and adjustable-speed motors and machines
    with and without compound windings, and with and without compensating windings.
