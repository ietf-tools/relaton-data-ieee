abstract:
- content: Software engineering is an emerging field. New terms are continually being
    generated, and new meanings are being adopted for existing terms. The Glossary
    of Software Engineering Terminology was undertaken to document this vocabulary.
    Its purpose is to identify terms currently used in software engineering and to
    present the current meanings of these terms. It is intended to serve as a useful
    reference for software engineers and for those in related fields and to promote
    clarity and consistency in the vocabulary of software engineering. It is recognized
    that software engineering is a dynamic area; thus the standard will be subject
    to appropriate change as becomes necessary.
