abstract:
- content: General types of load tap changer (LTC) mechanisms, breathing configurations,
    and electrical designs, described for reference for determining methods of testing
    and evaluating dissolved gases in mineral-based transformer oils in LTCs, are
    discussed and recommended in this guide. Measurements of dissolved gas concentrations
    in the LTC oil are required to implement this guide. This guide is not manufacturer
    specific, rather category specific. ** Downloads file posted at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/C57/C57.139-2015/
