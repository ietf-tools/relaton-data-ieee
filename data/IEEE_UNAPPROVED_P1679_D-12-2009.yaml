abstract:
- content: This document covers recommended information for an objective evaluation
    of an emerging energy storage technology device or system by a potential user
    for any stationary application. Energy storage technologies are those that provide
    a means for the reversible storage of electrical energy, i.e. the device receives
    electrical energy and is able to discharge electrical energy at a later time.
    The storage medium may be electrochemical (e.g. batteries), kinetic (e.g. flywheels),
    electrostatic (e.g. electric double-layer capacitors), thermal, or some other
    medium. Devices recharged by non-electrical means, such as fuel cells, are beyond
    the scope of this document.
