abstract:
- content: Requirements are presented for subracks, plug-in units, printed boards,
    and backplanes to be used in conjunction with IEEE Std 1301-1991 and with a 2
    mm connector as defined in EIA IS-64 (1991). The general arrangement, dimensions,
    and environmental requirements are covered. This standard may be used with other
    P1301.x connector implementations in the same subrack.<<ETX>>
