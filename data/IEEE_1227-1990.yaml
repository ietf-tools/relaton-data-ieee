abstract:
- content: Guidance is provided for measuring the electric-field strength, ion-current
    density, conductivity, monopolar space-charge density, and net space-charge density
    in the vicinity of HVDC power lines, in converter substations, and in apparatus
    designed to simulate the HVDC power-line environment.
