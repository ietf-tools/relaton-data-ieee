abstract:
- content: 'This amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.10 fully defines how the addressing
    and route information (already defined in the recommended practice) are to be
    used by the routing modes (also currently defined in the recommended practice),
    including at least the following: end-to-end (E2E) acknowledgment from mesh route
    in non-storing mode; peer-to-peer (P2P) routing using a combination of up/down
    routing in non-storing mode; on-demand P2P routing for E2E acknowledgment in non-storing
    mode; on-demand path storing when sending unicast in non-storing mode.'
