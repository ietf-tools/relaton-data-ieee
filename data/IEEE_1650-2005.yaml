abstract:
- content: Recommended methods and standardized reporting practices for electrical
    characterization of carbon nanotubes are covered. Due to the nature of carbon
    nanotubes, significant measurement errors can be introduced if the electrical
    characterization design-of-experiment is not properly addressed. This standard
    describes the most common sources of measurement error, particularly for high-impedance
    electrical measurements commonly required for carbon nanotubes. This standard
    also gives recommended practices in order to minimize and/or characterize the
    effect of measurement artifacts and other sources of error encountered while measuring
    carbon nanotubes.
