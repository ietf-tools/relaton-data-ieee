abstract:
- content: Recommended methods and standardized reporting practices for electrical
    characterization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are covered. Due to the nature of
    CNTs, significant measurement errors can be introduced if the electrical characterization
    design-of-experiment is not properly addressed. The most common sources of measurement
    error, particularly for high impedance electrical measurements commonly required
    for CNTs, are described. Recommended practices in order to minimize and/or characterize
    the effect of measurement artifacts and other sources of error encountered while
    measuring CNTs are given.
