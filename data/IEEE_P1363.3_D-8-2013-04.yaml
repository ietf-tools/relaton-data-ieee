abstract:
- content: This standard specifies common identity-based public-key cryptographic
    techniques that use pairings, including mathematical primitives for secret value
    (key) derivation, public-key encryption, and digital signatures, and cryptographic
    schemes based on those primitives. It also specifies related cryptographic parameters,
    public keys and private keys. The purpose of this standard is to provide a reference
    for specifications of a variety of techniques from which applications may select.
