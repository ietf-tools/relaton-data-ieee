abstract:
- content: Information on the concepts of protection of ac transmission lines is presented
    in this guide. Applications of the concepts to accepted transmission line-protection
    schemes are also presented. Many important issues, such as coordination of settings,
    operating times, characteristics of relays, mutual coupling of lines, automatic
    reclosing, and use of communication channels, are examined. Special protection
    systems, protection of multi-terminal lines, and single-phase tripping and reclosing
    are also included. The impact of different electrical parameters and system performance
    considerations on the selection of relays and protection schemes is discussed.
    The purpose of this guide is to provide a reference for the selection of relay
    schemes and to assist less experienced protective relaying engineers in applying
    protection schemes to transmission lines.
