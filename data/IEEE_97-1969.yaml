abstract:
- content: This document has been prepared as a guide for technical committees to
    use when standards are being prepared or revised, with the object of obtaining
    consistency, as far as practicable, among the standards for various kinds of electric
    equipment, which must often operate under the same service conditions. Service
    conditions are specified to give the limiting conditions of operation for which
    standard equipment is designed. For example, ambient temperature values should
    be selected which, in combination with standard temperature rises, limit total
    insulation temperatures to suitable values. By specifying a limiting ambient value
    in service conditions, a readily usable simple means of stating conditions for
    which standard ratings are suitable is provided. This document consists of two
    parts. As far as possible selections should be made from Part I for the statement
    of service conditions for particular equipment standards. For uniformity it is
    suggested that the exact wording be used where it applies. Part II covers application
    and testing. Selections from this part are recommended for inclusion as supplementary
    information to specific standards where applicable and desirable.
