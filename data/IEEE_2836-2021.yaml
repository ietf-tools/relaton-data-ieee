abstract:
- content: Performance testing of electrical energy storage (EES) system in electric
    charging stations in combination with photovoltaic (PV) is covered in this recommended
    practice. General technical requirements of the test, the duty cycle development,
    and characteristics are given. Based on these, detailed test protocol based on
    duty cycle, such as stored energy, roundtrip efficiency, step response time, ramp
    rate, and duty cycle roundtrip efficiency, etc. are provided.
