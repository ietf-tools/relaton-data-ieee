abstract:
- content: This standard is applied to ac adjustable speed drive (ASD) systems rated
    above 375 kW and above 750 V output voltage as used in petrochemical and similar
    applications. The performance requirements for an ASD system including, but not
    limited to, input transformer or reactor as required, power electronics, control
    interfaces, cooling system, switchgear, and motor are covered. Requirements for
    power quality, engineering analysis, start-up assistance, training, and spare
    parts are also included. Certain items such as the motor, switchgear, or transformer
    may be excluded from the scope of vendor supply if specified in the data sheets;
    any special requirements for the excluded equipment shall be given by the system
    vendor.
