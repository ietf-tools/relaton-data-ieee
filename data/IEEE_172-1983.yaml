abstract:
- content: This standard represents a revision of material contained in the previous
    edition of IEEE Std 172-1971. The committee reviewed all of the terms, selected
    those which it considered appropriate, and deleted others. In preparation for
    this revision, the committee has included additional definitions relating to marine
    navigation, updated navigation equipment definitions, and included navigation
    terms where appropriate for completeness. This revision additionally encompasses
    suggestions and recommendations from a number of IEEE committees and panels who
    have contributed to this standard.
