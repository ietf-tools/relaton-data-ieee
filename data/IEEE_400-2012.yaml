abstract:
- content: Various field test methods that are currently available or under development
    are listed in this guide. The guide covers shielded, insulated power cable systems
    rated 5 kV and above. The guide describes the tests and gives advantages and disadvantages,
    suggested applications, and typical results. Complete guides covering some of
    the test methods listed are available in the form of IEEE 400 "point" documents.
