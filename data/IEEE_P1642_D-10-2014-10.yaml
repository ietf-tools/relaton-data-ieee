abstract:
- content: This recommended practice establishes appropriate electromagnetic (EM)
    threat levels, protection methods, monitoring techniques, and test techniques
    for specific classes of computer equipment. This equipment is expected to be accessible
    to the public at ranges less than 100 meters, and the loss of operation of the
    equipment due to intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) is expected to
    cause losses (both financial and of confidence) to businesses operating computer
    equipment, which are providing services to the public or to private companies.
    The principle class of equipment to be considered in this recommended practice
    includes fixed (non21 mobile) computer equipment. Examples include automated teller
    machines (ATMs), electronic cash registers at stores, computer equipment in banks
    and at airports, computer equipment controlling traffic flow, computer equipment
    controlling communications or allowing Internet access, computer equipment providing
    police, fire and security services, computer equipment controlling the operation
    of the power grid (including smart meters), computer equipment operating in hospitals,
    etc.
