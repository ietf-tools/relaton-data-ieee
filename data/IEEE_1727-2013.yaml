abstract:
- content: Induced voltage working procedures for underground transmission circuits
    are established in this guide. A transmission circuit when de-energized will have
    an induced voltage when in a common duct bank with an energized circuit. The induced
    voltage may be a possible safety hazard. The induced voltage may be determined
    by modeling the circuits and by measurement. This guide addresses the working
    procedures to follow when performing work where induced voltage is present.
