abstract:
- content: This standard prescribes the mechanical, electrical, and test requirements
    for the design, construction, and installation of electric penetration assemblies
    in containment structures for stationary nuclear power generating stations. The
    electric conductor and insulation characteristics of external circuits which connect
    to penetration assemblies are beyond the scope of these criteria. If there should
    be any conflict between this standard and those documents referenced herein, this
    standard shall take precedence over the referenced documents.
