abstract:
- content: Diagnostic tests and measurements that are performed in the field on fluid-filled
    power transformers and regulators are described. Whenever possible, shunt reactors
    are treated in a similar manner to transformers. Tests are presented systematically
    in categories depending on the subsystem of the unit being examined. A diagnostic
    chart is included as an aid to identify the various subsystems. Additional information
    is provided regarding specialized test and measuring techniques. Interpretive
    discussions are also included in several areas to provide additional insight on
    the particular test or to provide guidance on acceptance criteria. These discussions
    are based on the authors' judgment of accepted practice. It should be noted that
    the results of several types of tests should be interpreted together to diagnose
    a problem. Manufacturers' acceptance criteria should also be consulted as it may
    take precedence over the criteria in this guide.
