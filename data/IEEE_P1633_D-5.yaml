abstract:
- content: Software Reliability (SR) models have been evaluated & ranked for their
    applicability to various situations. The revision will reflect advances in SR
    since 1992, including modeling & prediction for distributed & network systems.
    Situation specific usage guidance will be refined & updated. The included methodology
    tools will be extended over the software life cycle.
