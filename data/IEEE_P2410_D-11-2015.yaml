abstract:
- content: Identity assertion, role gathering, multilevel access control, assurance,
    and auditing are provided by the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS). The
    BOPS implementation includes software running on a client device (smartphone or
    mobile device), a trusted BOPS server, and an intrusion detection system. The
    BOPS implementation allows pluggable components to replace existing components
    functionality, accepting integration into current operating environments in a
    short period of time. The BOPS implementation provides continuous protection to
    the resources and assurance of the placement and viability of adjudication and
    other key features. Accountability is the mechanism that proves a service-level
    guarantee of security. The BOPS implementation allows the systems to meet security
    needs by using the application programming interface. The BOPS implementation
    need not know whether the underlying system is a relational database management
    system or a search engine. The BOPS implementation functionality offers a point-and-cut
    mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as
    to the systems in development. The architecture is language neutral, allowing
    Representational State Transfer (REST), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and
    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security to provide the communication
    interface. The architecture is built on the servlet specification, open SSLs,
    Java, JSON, REST, and an open persistent store. All tools adhere to open standards,
    allowing maximum interoperability.
