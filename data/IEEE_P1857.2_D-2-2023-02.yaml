abstract:
- content: A set of tools to support specific audio coding functions including general
    audio coding and lossless audio coding are defined in this standard. The tool
    set defined in combination provides regular high-quality and efficient coding
    tool sets for compression, decompression, processing, and representing of audio
    data to save bandwidth for transmission; to save space for storage; to speed up
    indexing and multimedia search; and to enhance performance when using mixed media
    for virtual reality and other applications that demand high bandwidth. The target
    applications and services include but are not limited to audio transmission, audio
    recording, Internet streaming, and other video/audio-enabled services and applications.
