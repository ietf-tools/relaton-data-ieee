abstract:
  content: WirelessMAN-OFDMA TDD operation in exclusively licensed spectrum with channel
    bandwidth from 100 kHz up to 1.25 MHz, including 1 MHz explicitly, is specified.
    This amendment targets operation in the 700 MHz band but also supports operation
    in other VHF/UHF bands. The project amends Clause 12 of IEEE Std 802.16-2012,
    adding a new system profile and amending other clauses as required to support
    the narrower channel widths. The range and data rate supported by the added profile
    are commensurate with those of the base standard, as scaled by the reduced channel
    bandwidth.
