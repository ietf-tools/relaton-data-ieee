abstract:
- content: To assure that the performance of the cable joint will equal the performance
    of the cable it joins electrical ratings and test requirements are established
    for cable joints. These are applicable to cable joints for use with extruded dielectric
    shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 5000 V through 46000 V and
    cable joints for use with laminated dielectric cable rated in preferred voltage
    steps from 2500 V through 500000 V.<<ETX>>
