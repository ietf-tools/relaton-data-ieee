abstract:
- content: This document describes the IEEE PES s vision of the power system infrastructure
    into the year 2050. This document sets the stage and includes future scenarios,
    electricity generation (Make), electricity transmission and distribution (Move),
    and electricity usage (Use). It also covers the related Operations and Control
    issues. The document uses scenarios from the International Energy Agency (IEA),
    which defines future energy availability, production and usage into the year 2050.
