abstract:
- content: The goal of this roadmap is to stimulate discussion and challenge ideas
    around the deployment of power and energy technologies. The IEEE PES (Power &amp;
    Energy Society) Horizon 2050 team gives a general indication of when technologies
    could be expected for deployment, and the team takes a step forward and tries
    to group research and standard development needs for the required power and energy
    technologies in the future. The reader shall not consider these proposals as rigid
    temporal indications, but as relative timeframes. This information can be challenged
    by any reader, and the IEEE PES Horizon 2050 team hopes that these challenges
    will lead to productive initiatives to select future investment in innovation
    and standards. For Corporate or Institutional Access, request a custom quote for
