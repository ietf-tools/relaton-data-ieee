abstract:
- content: A method of measuring the amplitude levels of an SMPTE 170M-1994; NTSC
    color or monochrome television video signal is described. It is concerned with
    luminance measurements at various points in transmission systems where the signals
    are at video frequencies. The methods described are limited to the use of waveform
    monitors, software video processing for amplitude assessment, or suitable oscilloscopes,
    and are primarily directed to specifying means of measuring television signal
    levels for operating purposes.
