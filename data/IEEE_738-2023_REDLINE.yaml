abstract:
- content: A numerical method by which the core and surface temperatures of a bare
    overhead conductor are related to the steady or time-varying electrical current
    and weather conditions is described in this standard. Contents discussed also
    include how this method may be used to determine the conductor’s current for a
    corresponding conductor temperature limit. Please note the content in this standard
    does not recommend suitable weather conditions or conductor parameters for use
    in line rating calculations.
