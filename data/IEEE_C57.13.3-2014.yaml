abstract:
- content: General and specific recommendations for grounding current and voltage
    transformer secondary circuits and cases of connected equipment are covered in
    this guide. Although most diagrams included in this guide show relaying applications,
    the recommended practices apply equally to metering and other areas where instrument
    transformers are used. Grounding practices presently used, and practices that
    were not previously reported, are included in this guide. Specifically, a review
    of other than North American grounding practices is included.
