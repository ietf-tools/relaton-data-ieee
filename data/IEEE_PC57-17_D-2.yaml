abstract:
  content: This standard covers electrical characteristics and mechanical features
    of liquid-immersed transformers 69 kV or less (but not limited to 69 kV), used
    for supplying electric power to direct arc-melting furnaces. All characteristics
    and definitions, except as specifically covered in this standard, shall be in
    accordance with the IEEE Requirements for Liquid-Immersed Distribution, Power,
    and Regulating Transformers (C57.12 Series).
