abstract:
- content: A set of YANG modules describing nanoscale communication systems and their
    associated physical quantities in conformance with IEEE Std 1906.1-2015--a common
    framework for all nanoscale communication technologies--are comprised by this
    data model. Physics unique to the nanoscale are represented by the model. The
    physics are referred to as non-standard, required by IEEE Std 1906.1-2015. Remote
    configuration and management for remote simulation, operation, and analysis of
    nanoscale communication systems are defined by the model. A self-describing data
    structure is defined by the model for datastores and repositories of nanoscale
    communication experimental data enabling a common understanding of the data from
    a wide variety of nanoscale communication media and technologies. Augmentation
    of the IEEE Std 1906.1-2015 common core components with details specific to the
    physics of the nanoscale communication system is allowed by the model. Techniques
    used by the model facilitate reuse and augmentation. In addition, extensions to
    IEEE Std 802.1Q and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) interfaces--allowing
    reusability within existing networks, which implies a macroscale to nanoscale
    interface, and defines nanoscale communication as a feature for bridge ports as
    defined in IEEE Std 802.1 - are provided. The model is composed of simple, required
    core components while allowing optional, device-specific components and metrics
    to be added. There is conformity with best practices as defined by the IEEE 802
    YANG editors' coordination committee and IETF RFC 6087, and consideration of coexistence
    and interoperability with existing domain models and tools, such as the Systems
    Biology Markup Language (SBML).
