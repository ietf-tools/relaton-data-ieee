abstract:
- content: This standard provides guidance to users of IEEE standards as to how they
    could apply them to meet the quality management expectations of ISO 9001:2000
    clauses and sub-clauses in a software development context by adopting ISO/IEC
    90003 (the software development guidance document for ISO 9001) and adding an
    informative annex to cross-reference IEEE S2ESC standards to relevant ISO 9001
    material. This standard is identical with ISO/IEC 90003 but contains an additional
    informative annex, Annex C, cross-referencing material in ISO 9001 with material
    in S2ESC standards which could be helpful in meeting the intent of ISO 9001 as
    well as a second additional annex, Annex D, which is a bibliography of the specific
    IEEE standards referenced.
