abstract:
- content: This IEEE recommended practice provides recommendations for the testing
    and start-up of electric heat tracing systems in power generating stations. The
    recommendations include the testing sequence of materials and components of the
    electric heat tracing system, installation, and pre-operational testing of the
    system, and verification of system performance.<<ETX>>
