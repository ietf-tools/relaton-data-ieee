abstract:
- content: Field testing methodology and techniques are presented for measuring parameters
    for dc transmission lines and earth electrode lines are discussed in this guide.
    The topics addressed include the basic requirements of measurement, safety cautions,
    requirements for test instruments, testing induced voltage and current, verifying
    the polarity and testing insulation resistance, measuring dc resistance, measuring
    the impedance frequency characteristic, and various factors that can distort measurements.
