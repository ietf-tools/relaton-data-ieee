abstract:
- content: A guide for the development of a functional specification for electric
    transportation fast charging station management and control systems, including
    the energy management and grid interaction functions, is provided in this document.
    The fast charging station may incorporate local energy sources, including renewable
    energy resources such as solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery energy
    storage systems. The document develops guiding principles for the implementation
    and deployment of fast charging station control systems and the basic functional
    requirements for the control system and presents a set of core functions. These
    include electric transportation energy storage discovery and evaluation of charging
    requirements; monitoring and control of charging profiles; charging station energy
    estimation, energy scheduling, and management; and charging station grid interaction
    and grid power exchange management. Grid code requirements and ancillary services
    provision are addressed.
