abstract:
- content: Synchronized phasor (synchrophasor) measurements for power systems are
    presented. This standard defines synchrophasors, frequency, and rate of change
    of frequency (ROCOF) measurement under all operating conditions. It specifies
    methods for evaluating these measurements and requirements for compliance with
    the standard under both steady-state and dynamic conditions. Time tag and synchronization
    requirements are included. Performance requirements are confirmed with a reference
    model, provided in detail. This document defines a phasor measurement unit (PMU),
    which can be a stand-alone physical unit or a functional unit within another physical
    unit. This standard does not specify hardware, software, or a method for computing
    phasors, frequency, or ROCOF.
