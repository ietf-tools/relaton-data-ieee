abstract:
- content: 'This standard describes the system-level requirements needed to ensure
    service-level, multi-vendor interoperability of Ethernet Passive Optical Network
    (EPON) equipment. The specifications complement the existing IEEE Std 802.3 and
    IEEE Std 802.1 standards which ensure the interoperability at the Physical layer
    and Data Link layer. Specifically included in this specification are: -- EPON
    system-level interoperability specifications covering equipment functionality,
    traffic engineering, and service-level QoS/CoS mechanisms; --Management specifications
    covering: equipment management, service management, and EPON power-saving mechanism'
