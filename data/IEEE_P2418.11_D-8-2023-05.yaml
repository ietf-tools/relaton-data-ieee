abstract:
- content: 'e-Voting is an application of modern Web 3 and distributed ledger technology
    (DLT) for more choices and security in registration and voting. Choices range
    from voting with anonymous paper ballots and postal mail, to online voting where
    an electronic ballot can be authenticated that it was received and recorded as
    intended. For security, DLT-enabled systems: validate sources with cryptographic
    methods, secure communications with digital signatures, and confirm valid transaction
    with a transparent ledger. Suspicious transactions are recorded as part of a private
    real-time audit and database, and e-Voting can be tailored for the local needs
    and methods of a country or administrative sub-division.'
