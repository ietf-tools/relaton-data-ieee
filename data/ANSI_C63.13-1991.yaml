abstract:
- content: A basic understanding of the application, evaluation, and safety considerations
    of electromagnetic interference (EMI) power-line filters used in both AC and DC
    applications is provided. The construction of an EMI power-line filter and its
    functions in providing suppression of conducted noise are described. The functions
    and performance of the filter components, particularly the capacitors and inductors,
    are discussed. It is explained why seemingly identical filters may not give the
    same performance in a particular application. No-load insertion-loss test methods
    are presented. Proper installation of the filters in equipment is discussed. Safety
    regulations are briefly addressed.
