abstract:
- content: 'This International Standard, within the context of methods and tools for
    MBSSE: &#8226; Provides terms and definitions related to MBSSE; &#8226; Defines
    MBSSE-specific processes for model-based systems and software engineering; the
    processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and outcomes; &#8226;
    Defines methods to support the defined tasks of each process; &#8226; Defines
    tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or methods. The processes defined
    in this document are applicable for a single project, as well as for an organization
    performing multiple projects. These processes are applicable for managing and
    performing the systems engineering activities based on models within any stage
    in the life cycle of a system of interest. Annex D (informative) Relationship
    with other standards describes the relationships between this document and other
    standards.'
