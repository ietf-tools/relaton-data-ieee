abstract:
- content: The XES standard defines a grammar for a tag-based language whose aim is
    to provide designers of information systems with a unified and extensible methodology
    for capturing systems behaviors by means of event logs and event streams. This
    standard includes a XML Schema describing the structure of an XES event log/stream
    and a XML Schema describing the structure of an extension of such a log/stream.
    Moreover, the standard includes a basic collection of so-called XES extension
    prototypes that provide semantics to certain attributes as recorded in the event
    log/stream.
