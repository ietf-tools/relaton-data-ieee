abstract:
- content: The protection of motors used in industrial and commercial power systems
    is covered. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer
    with limited experience in the area of protection and control. It can also be
    an aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and
    commercial power systems.
