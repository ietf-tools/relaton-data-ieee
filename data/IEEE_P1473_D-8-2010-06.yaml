abstract:
- content: Communications protocols to be used for inter-unit and intra-unit serial
    data communications between subsystems aboard passenger trains are defined by
    this standard. Minimum acceptable parameters for a network that can simultaneously
    handle monitoring and control traffic from multiple systems are set forth.While
    the network is not vital, it is intended to be capable of carrying vital messages
