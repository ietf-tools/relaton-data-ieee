abstract:
- content: USEMCSC C63.25.2 is a stand-alone standard for site validation measurements
    of radiated emission test sites from 30 MHz to 1 GHz. The site validation techniques
    covered are the site comparison method (SCM) and the delta normalized site attenuation
    (DNSA) method. In addition, the traditional normalized site attenuation method
    is retained for continuity. This standard incorporates Annex D of ANSI C63.4-2014
    + A1-2017 [B16] as well as necessary information from ANSI C63.5-2017 related
    strictly to site validation requirements (for example, antennas allowed to be
    used, geometry-specific correction factors for biconical dipoles used in normalized
    site attenuation measurements). This standard can be referenced by other Accredited
    National Standards Committee (ANSC) C63 standards where site validation requirements
    are necessary
