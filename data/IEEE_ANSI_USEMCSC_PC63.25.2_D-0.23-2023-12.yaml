abstract:
- content: ANSI/USEMCSC C63.25.2 is a stand-alone standard for site validation measurements
    of radiated emission test sites from 30 MHz to 1 GHz. The site validation techniques
    covered are the site comparison method and the delta normalized site attenuation
    method. In addition, the traditional normalized site attenuation method is retained
    for continuity. This standard incorporates Annex D of ANSI C63.4-2014 and ANSI
    C63.14a-2017 as well as necessary information from ANSI C63.5-2017 related strictly
    to site validation requirements (for example, antennas allowed to be used, geometry-specific
    correction factors for biconical dipoles used in normalized site attenuation measurements).
    This standard can be referenced by other ANSI/USEMCSC C63 standards where site
    validation requirements are necessary.
