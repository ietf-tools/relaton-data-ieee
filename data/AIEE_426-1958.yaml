abstract:
- content: These standards are supplementary to, and should be used in conjunction
    with American Standard Y32.2, Graphical Symbols for Electrical Diagrams. The following
    are some points of general philosophy underlying their development:1. The symbol
    structure should reflect the past, i.e., the symbols should, within a logical
    framework, revert in their simplest forms to those commonly in present case.2.
    The symbol structure should look to the future, i.e.. it should be capable of
    extension to the many new semiconductor devices that may become available.3. The
    symbol structure should indicate physical properties when this is possible without
    over complication.Section 2 illustrates the application of the ancillary symbols
    of Section 1 to a variety of semiconductor devices. For Methods of Test and Letter
    Symbols for Semiconductor Devices, see AIEE Standard No. 425.
