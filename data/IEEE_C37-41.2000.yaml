abstract:
- content: Required procedures for performing design tests for high-voltage distribution-class
    and power-class fuses, as well as for fuse disconnecting switches and enclosed
    single-pole air switches are specified. These design tests, as appropriate to
    a particular device, include the following test types-dielectric, interrupting,
    load-break, making current, radio-influence, short-time current, temperature-rise,
    time-current, mechanical, and liquid-tightness.
