abstract:
- content: This amendment defines modifications to the IEEE 802.11 medium access control
    (MAC); the physical layer (PHY) service interface of High Efficiency (HE) and
    Extremely High Throughput (EHT) PHYs; and to the Directional Multi Gigabit (DMG)
    and enhanced DMG (EDMG) PHYs to enhance Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) sensing
    operation in license-exempt frequency bands between 1 GHz and 7.125 GHz and above
    45 GHz.
