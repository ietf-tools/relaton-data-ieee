abstract:
- content: The wide range of calibrator-type instruments currently being used primarily
    for radionuclide assay in nuclear medicine indicates the need for a standard for
    uniformity in measurement and test techniques. Such devices are composite systems
    consisting of an ionization chamber integrally coupled to appropriate electronic
    circuitry that converts the ionization current to a readout in units of activity.
    The principles of operation of the ionization chamber are well summarized in the
    NCRP Report No 58 [1] 1 and will not be repeated here. Wide activity range and
    stability are useful characteristics of ionization chambers in this application.
    The advantages of this type of system for radionuclide assay include ease of use
    and interpretation.
