abstract:
- content: The use of the impulse generator for calibration purposes in electromagnetic
    compatibility measurements is addressed. In particular, basic information relating
    to the use of this device is provided, and interpretation of measurements made
    using instruments based on it is considered. Two methods of measurement of spectrum
    amplitude and impulse bandwidth are described in detail. The first method uses
    a video pulse technique. The second uses a substitution method in which the reference
    is a pulse- modulated sine-wave generator whose parameters are measured. Both
    techniques are capable of about equal accuracy.
