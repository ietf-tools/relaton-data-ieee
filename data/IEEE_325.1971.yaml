abstract:
- content: 'Germanium detectors are extensively used for the detection and analysis
    of gamma-radiation primarily because of their excellent energy resolution. The
    rapid development and utilization of these detectors in a variety of technical
    disciplines have made standard test procedures desirable so that measurements
    may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users.These test procedures
    are not intended to imply that all tests described herein are mandatory,but only
    that such tests as are carried out on completed devices should be performed in
    accordance with these recommended procedures. These test procedures are a supplement
    to the following documents: IEEE Std 300-1969, Test Procedure for Semiconductor
    Radiation Detectors, (ANSI N42.1-1969) and IEEE Std 301-1969, Test Procedure for
    Amplifiers and Preamplifiers for Semiconductor Radiation Detectors, (ANSI N42.2-1969).'
