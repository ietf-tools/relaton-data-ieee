abstract:
- content: This publication pertains to wide-band transformers, transmitting power
    of equal to or more than 100 W. Guides to application and test procedures are
    included. Appendices contain certain precautions and recommended practices. Provision
    is made for including data for use in the design of feedback amplifiers and control
    networks or other circuits in which knowledge of the transformer amplitude and
    phase-frequency response is needed by the system designer. These transformers
    are required to transform voltage within specified tolerances of amplitude and
    phase when operating between specified impedances.
