abstract:
- content: 'These test procedures are to bring up to date the IRE "Standards on Facsimile-Temporary
    Test Standards-1943" (43 IRE 9.S1). In part there has been new experience and
    technological advance since then. But it has also been noted that that document
    could, to advantage, be made more complete and cover a wider range of tests. An
    important objective has therefore been to make the new test procedures more comprehensive,
    to cover tests for determining most of the measurable quantities that were defined
    in IRE Standards on Facsimile: Definitions of Terms (56 IRE 9.S1, ASA C16.30-1957)
    now IEEE No. 168. The scope, in part, has been derived from facsimile equipment
    designed to operate over a telephone frequency bandwidth, but the tests are described
    in a general way, to make them utilizable over wider bandwidths as far as possible.'
