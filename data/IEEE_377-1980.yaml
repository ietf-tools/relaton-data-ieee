abstract:
- content: This recommended practice covers definitions of terms, controlled test
    conditions, test apparatus, test methods and data presentation, all of which form
    the basis for establishing the energy levels of spurious emissions of mobile communication
    transmitters designed to generate frequency-modulated (FM) signals in the frequency
    range of 25 MHz to 1000 MHz. Procedures for measuring both broadband and narrowband
    spectra are provided for both conducted and radiated emissions. Specified limits
    are not included. However, reference values which are not limited by the state
    of the art are provided. Transmitter test conditions, apparatus and method are
    based on standard instrumentation and measuring techniques and do not require
    any special apparatus other than necessary terminal simulators. The procedures
    do not cover the associated antenna and transmission lines.<<ETX>>
