abstract:
- content: Controlled test conditions, test apparatus, test methods and data presentation,
    all of which form the basis for establishing the energy levels of spurious emissions
    of mobile communication transmitters designed to generate FM signals in the frequency
    range of 25 to 1000 MHz are covered. The purpose is to enable design and system
    engineers engaged in a variety of development projects to achieve uniform results
    in recognizing sources and nature of RF spurious emissions emanating from vehicular
    communications transmitters. Procedures for measuring both broadband and narrowband
    spectra are provided for both conducted and radiated emissions. Specified limits
    are not included. However, reference values that are not limited by the state
    of the art are provided. Transmitter test conditions, apparatus and method are
    based on standard instrumentation and measuring techniques and do not require
    any special apparatus other than necessary terminal simulators. The procedures
    do not cover the associated antenna and transmission lines.
