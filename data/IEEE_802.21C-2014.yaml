abstract:
- content: Additional IEEE 802(R) media access independent mechanisms that optimize
    handovers between possibly heterogeneous IEEE 802 systems and between IEEE 802
    systems and cellular systems to enable improved handover performance for single-radio
    devices are specified in this standard.
