abstract:
- content: Specification and test requirements for a single-axis interferometric fiber
    optic gyro (IFOG) for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement
    measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. A standard
    specification format guide for the preparation of a single-axis IFOG is provided.
    A compilation of recommended procedures for testing a fiber optic gyro, derived
    from those presently used in the industry, is also provided.
