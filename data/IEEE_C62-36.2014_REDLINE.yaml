abstract:
- content: Surge protectors for application on multiconductor balanced or unbalanced
    data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages equal to or less than
    1000 Vrms, or 1200 V dc are covered by this standard. These surge protectors are
    designed to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both. The methods of testing
    and criteria for determining the end of life of electrical surge protectors used
    in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits are described. The
    surge protectors covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations
    of linear or nonlinear elements, packaged for the purpose of limiting voltage,
    current, or both. This standard is not intended to cover packaged single gas tube,
    air gap, varistor, or avalanche junction surge-protective devices, which are covered
    by IEEE Std C62.31(TM), IEEE Std C62.32(TM), IEEE Std C62.33(TM), and IEEE Std
    C62.35(TM), respectively.
