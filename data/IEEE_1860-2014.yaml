abstract:
- content: This guide applies to voltage and reactive power control in 1000 kV and
    above ac systems. It establishes criteria and requirements for electric power
    utilities in the planning, design, infrastructure, operation, and scientific research
    of voltage or reactive power in 1000 kV and above ac systems, which should guarantee
    the system stability and equipment safety.
