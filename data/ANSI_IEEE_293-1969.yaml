abstract:
- content: Recommended rate gyro test procedures derived from those currently in use,
    including test conditions to be considered, are compiled. In some cases alternate
    methods for measuring a performance characteristic have been included. This standard
    is intended to be a guide in the preparation of Section 4 of a specification that
    follows the format of IEEE Std 292, Specification Format for Single-Degree-of-Freedom
    Spring-Restrained Rate Gyros.
