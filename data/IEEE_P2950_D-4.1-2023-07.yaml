abstract:
- content: Electric traction system can realize traction and electric braking function
    of high speed Electirc Multiple Units(EMUs). It is the core system of high speed
    EMUs and mainly composed of traction transformer, traction converter, and traction
    motor. This standard specifies the service conditions, system configuration, technical
    requirements, tests and their methods for electric traction system on board high
    speed EMUs).
