abstract:
- content: Air gaps for overvoltage protection applications on systems with operating
    voltages equal to or less than 600 V rms are covered. These protective devices
    are designed for limiting the voltages on balanced or unbalanced communication,
    power, and signaling circuits. A series of standard design tests for determining
    the electrical characteristics of these air gap devices is specified. The tests
    provide a means of comparison among various air gap surge-protective devices.
