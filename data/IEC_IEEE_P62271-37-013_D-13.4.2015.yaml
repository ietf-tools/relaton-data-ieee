abstract:
  content: This part of IEC 62271 is applicable to three-phase a.c. high-voltage generator
    circuitbreakers,hereafter called generator circuit-breaker, designed for indoor
    or outdoor installationand for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on
    systems having voltages above 1 kVand up to 38 kV.It is applicable to generator
    circuit-breakers that are installed between the generator and thetransformer terminals.
    Requirements relative to generator circuit-breakers intended for usewith generators
    and transformers rated 10 MVA or more are covered specifically. Generatorcircuits
    rated less than 10 MVA and pumped storage installations are considered specialapplications,
    and their requirements are not completely covered by this standard.This standard
    is also applicable to the operating mechanisms of generator circuit-breakersand
    to their auxiliary equipment.
