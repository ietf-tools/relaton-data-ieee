abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the design requirements for new and/or modified
    Class 1E control boards, panels, and racks and establishes the methods to verify
    that these requirements have been satisfied. Methods for meeting the separation
    criteria contained in ANSI/IEEE Std 384-1992 are addressed. Qualification is also
    included to address the overall requirements of ANSI/IEEE Std 323-1983 and ANSI/IEEE
    Std 344-1987.
