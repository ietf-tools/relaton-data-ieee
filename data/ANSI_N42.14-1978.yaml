abstract:
- content: Methods for the calibration and use of germanium spectrometers for the
    measurement of gamma-ray energies and emission rates over the energy range from
    59 keV to approximately 3000 keV, and for the calculation of source activities
    from these measurements, are established. Minimum requirements for automated peak
    finding are stated. Methods for measuring the full energy peak efficiency with
    calibrated sources are given. Performance tests that ascertain the proper functioning
    of the Ge spectrometer and evaluate the limitations of the algorithms used for
    locating and fitting single and multiple peaks are described. Methods for the
    measurement of, and the correction for pulse pileup are suggested. Techniques
    are recommended for the inspection of spectral-analysis results for large errors
    resulting from summing of cascade gamma rays in the detector. Suggestions are
    provided for the establishment of data libraries for radionuclide identification,
    decay corrections, and the conversion of gamma-ray rates to decay rates.
