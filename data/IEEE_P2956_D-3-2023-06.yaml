abstract:
- content: Uniform measurement procedures and technology are provided for determining
    the shielding effectiveness of shielded power cables and connectors for rail vehicles
    at frequencies from 9 kHz to 30 MHz (which can be extended according to the length
    of the device under test). The test methods include triaxial method and tube-in-tube
    method. These methods determine the shielding effectiveness by applying specified
    current and voltage to the screen of the cable and measuring the induced voltage
    in order to determine the surface transfer impedance.
