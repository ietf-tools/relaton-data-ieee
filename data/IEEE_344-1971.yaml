abstract:
- content: This guide provides direction for establishing procedures that will yield
    data which verify that the Class I electric equipment can meet its performance
    requirements during and following a design basis earthquake. This guide may be
    used by equipment manufactures to establish procedures that will yield data to
    substantiate performance claims or by equipment users to evaluate and verify performance
    of representative devices and assemblies as part of an overall qualification efforts.
