    and purpose of this standard. Clause 2 lists references to other standards that
    are useful in applying this standard. Clause 3 provides definitions that are either
    not found in other standards, or have been modified for use with this standard.
    Clause 4 provides a listing of the data elements in the standard data set and
    the additional data elements included with the extended data set. Clause 5 gives
    the specifics of the two test data file formats. Clause 6 addresses the methods
    of file transfer.
