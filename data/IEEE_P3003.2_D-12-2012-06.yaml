abstract:
- content: This recommended practice covers the grounding and bonding of equipment
    in industrial and commercial power systems. The interconnection and grounding
    of the non electrical metallic elements of a system is covered first. This is
    followed by a discussion of the objectives of equipment grounding, including minimizing
    electric shock hazard to personnel, providing adequate current carrying capability
    for ground faults, and ensuring the timely operation of overcurrent protection.
