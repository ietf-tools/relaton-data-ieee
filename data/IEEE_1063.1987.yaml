abstract:
- content: Minimum requirements for the structure and information content of user
    documentation are provided. They apply primarily to technical substance rather
    than to style. Editorial and stylistic considerations are addressed only when
    they impact structure and content. Only traditional documentation, either printed
    on paper or stored in some other medium in the format of a printed document and
    used in a manner analogous to the way a printed document is used, is addressed.
