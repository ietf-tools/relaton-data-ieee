abstract:
- content: Surge-protective devices (SPDs) intended to be installed on the load side
    of the service equipment connected to 50 Hz or 60 Hz AC power circuits rated at
    1000 V (root mean squared [rms]) or less are the focus of this standard. Performance
    characteristics and standard methods for testing and rating are established for
    these devices, which may be composed of any combination of components. The tests
    in this standard are aimed at providing comparisons among the variety of SPDs
    available.
