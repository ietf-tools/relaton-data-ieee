abstract:
- content: The characteristics and classification of current transformers (CTs) used
    for protective relaying are described. This guide also describes the conditions
    that cause the CT output to be distorted and the effects on relaying systems of
    this distortion. The selection and application of CTs for the more common protection
    schemes are also addressed.
