abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies modifications to the medium access control (MAC)
    mechanisms to preserve the existing services that might otherwise be restricted
    in environments where STAs in an ESS use randomized or changing MAC addresses,
    without affecting user privacy. This amendment introduces mechanisms to enable
    session continuity in the absence of unique MAC address-to-STA mapping.
