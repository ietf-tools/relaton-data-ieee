abstract:
  content: Superseded by 946-2004 (SH/SS95307). Guidance for the design of the dc
    auxiliary power systems for nuclear and large fossil-fueled power generating stations
    is provided. The components of the dc auxiliary power system, including lead storage
    batteries, static battery chargers, and distribution equipment, are addressed.
    Guidance for selecting the quantity and types of equipment, the equipment ratings,
    interconnections, instrumentation, control and protection is also provided.
