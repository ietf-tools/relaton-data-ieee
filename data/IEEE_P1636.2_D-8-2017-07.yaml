abstract:
- content: Promoting and facilitating interoperability components of automatic test
    systems where actions taken during maintenance need to be shared is addressed
    in this standard. The standard thus facilitates the capture of maintenance action
    information data in storage devices and databases, facilitating online and offline
    analysis. The maintenance action information schema becomes a class of information
    that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards. The exchange format is
    expressed in both the OWL and XML formats.
