abstract:
- content: 'This standard is designed for use in conjunction with other documents
    such as the IEEE 1101 group of standards, the IEEE 896 group of standards, the
    IEEE 1596 group of standards, the IEEE 1014 group of standards, and ISO/IEC 10861:
    1994. This standard is one of the IEEE P1156.x series for environmental specifications.
    It is intended to be used as a core specification. It contains minimum environmental
    withstand conditions applicable to computer systems and all of their associated
    components. It has been created to provide general environmental withstand conditions
    for one or more of the above listed computer buses or interconnect standards,
    and electronic equipment in general.'
