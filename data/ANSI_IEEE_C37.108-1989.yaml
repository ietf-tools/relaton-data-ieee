abstract:
- content: This guide is intended to aid those engineers who have reevaluated the
    risks associated with faults within network vaults, particularly for those network
    vaults located within or near highrise buildings. It will also identify currently
    available devices that are being used in network transformer protection schemes.
    These devices should act to sense the fault and initiate fault interruption locally
    or remotely, there by minimizing damage and restoration time. These devices will
    be described as to their fault detecting capabilities. An example utilizing a
    number of protective schemes is presented in Appendix B.
