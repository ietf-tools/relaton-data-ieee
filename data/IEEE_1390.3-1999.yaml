abstract:
- content: The telephone network interface to a utility controller operating under
    the utility telemetry service architecture is described. The interface is described
    in terms of a utility meter reading application but any enhanced service provider
    communication can be transported. Telemetry calls may be initiated by either the
    utility/service provider (outbound) or the telemetry interface unit (TIU)/CPE
    (inbound) on the end user's premises.
