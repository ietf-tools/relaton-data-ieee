abstract:
- content: MEDICAL DEVICEs that offer a communication interface as specified by the
    IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards can be integrated
    into a HEALTH IT SYSTEM to jointly execute SYSTEM FUNCTIONs. However, implementing
    the IEEE 11073 SDC communication protocol is not sufficient to demonstrate safety,
    effectiveness, and security of SYSTEM FUNCTIONs resulting from the combination
    of SYSTEM FUNCTION CONTRIBUTIONs from two or more MEDICAL DEVICEs. SDC PARTICIPANT
    KEY PURPOSEs (PKPs) are sets of requirements that support MANUFACTURERs in making
    valid assumptions about BICEPS PARTICIPANTs from other MANUFACTURERs. This common
    understanding allows for the MANUFACTURERs to perform RISK MANAGEMENT, verification,
    and USABILITY ENGINEERING for the safe use of SYSTEM FUNCTIONs. This standard
    specifies requirements for the allocation of responsibilities to SDC BASE PARTICIPANTs.
