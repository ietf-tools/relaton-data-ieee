abstract:
- content: The application guide for relay protection of squirrel-cage and wound-rotor
    induction motors presents a review of the generally accepted forms of motor protection
    and summarizes the use of relays and devices, singly and in combination, to enable
    the reader to properly select the necessary equipment to obtain adequate motor
    protection. The Guide is prepared primarily for the protection of three-phase
    integral-horsepower motors and refers to single- or two-phase motors only in special
    instances and only where specifically indicated. It is especially useful where
    the motor installation is sufficiently important, due to either its size or the
    consequences of motor malfunction, to justify specific design of the protective
    system. It also provides the information necessary to judge whether there are
    safety or economic reasons for such a specific design.
