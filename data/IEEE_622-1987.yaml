abstract:
- content: Recommended practices for designing, installing, and maintaining electric
    heat tracing systems are provided. These electric heat tracing systems are applied,
    both for critical process temperature control and for process temperature control,
    on mechanical piping systems that carry borated water, caustic soda, and other
    solutions. Electric heat tracing systems are also applied on water piping systems
    to prevent them from freezing in cold weather. The recommendations include identification
    of requirements, heater design considerations, power systems design considerations,
    temperature control considerations, alarm considerations, finished drawings and
    documents, installation of materials, startup testing, temperature tests, and
    maintenance of electric pipe heating systems.
