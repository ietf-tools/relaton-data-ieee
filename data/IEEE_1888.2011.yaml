abstract:
- content: The standard describes remote control architecture of digital community,
    intelligent building groups, and digital metropolitan networks; specifies interactive
    data format between devices and systems; and gives a standardized generalization
    of equipment, data communication interface, and interactive message in this digital
    community network. The digital community remote control network opens interfaces
    for public administration, public service, property management service, and individual
    service, which enables intelligent interconnection, collaboration service, remote
    surveillance, and central management to be feasible.
