abstract:
- content: These marine recommendations are intended to serve as a guide for the selection
    and installation of equipment on merchant vessels with electric apparatus for
    lighting, signaling, communication, power, and propulsion. The recommendations
    define what are considered good present-day engineering practices with reference
    to the safety of the personnel and of the ship itself as well as reliability and
    durability of the apparatus. It is recognized that changes and improvements in
    shipboard requirements may develop which are not specifically covered herein;
    such changes, if incorporated in the design, should be equal to the safety and
    reliability levels defined herein and generally in accord with the text of these
    standards. Specific IEEE standards are referenced in the text. Other IEEE standards
    should be followed to the extent applicable. Attention is directed to the fact
    that regulations for electric installations on shipboard are promulgated by Governmental
    Regulatory Agencies, the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization,
    and Classification Societies. Such regulations have been given due consideration
    in these recommendations, but there are areas where differences are expressed.
    Reference should always be made to those regulations which may be applicable to
    the design.
