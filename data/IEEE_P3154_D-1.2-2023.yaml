abstract:
- content: Talent is critically important for the success of companies, so a large
    number of talent services have developed over time. Institutions and enterprises
    are now implementing knowledge graph technology as part of Artificial Intelligence
    systems to provide more accurate and interpretable intelligent talent services.
    This recommended practice assists developers in constructing knowledge graphs
    in the field of talent services more efficiently and consistently. In addition,
    it provides a general implementation method for institutions and enterprises to
    use knowledge graphs in different application scenarios, such as talent recruitment
    and development.
