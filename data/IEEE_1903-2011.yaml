abstract:
- content: A framework of Internet Protocol (IP)-based service overlay networks is
    described and context-aware [e.g., such as required Quality of Service (QoS) level;
    type of service such as real time versus data; nature of data stream such as l-frame
    versus B-frame; and type of terminal such as TV monitor versus personal digital
    assistant], dynamically adaptive (e.g., using locally derived information to discover,
    organize, and maintain traffic flows in the network within a local area network),
    and self-organizing networking capabilities (e.g., developing network structures
    based on the needs of the customers and the capabilities of existing network structures),
    including advanced routing and forwarding schemes, that are independent of underlying
    networks, are specified in this Next Generation Service Overlay Network (NGSON)
    standard. The NGSON architecture provides advanced service- and transport-related
    functions to support context-aware, dynamically adaptive, and self-organizing
    networks. This standard specifies a functional architecture for NGSON. The functional
    architecture consists of a set of functional entities (FEs), their functions,
    reference points, and information flows to illustrate service interaction and
    media delivery among FEs and external components. NGSON may operate with different
    underlying networks such as IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), next generation network
    (NGN), peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay, or Web to transmit NGSON signaling messages
    and/or media among its users and services. Specifications of underlying networks
    are outside scope of this standard.
