abstract:
- content: Superseded by 12207:2008(E) (IEEE Std 12207-2008). ISO/IEC 12207 provides
    a common framework for developing and managing software. IEEE/EIA 12207.0 consists
    of the clarifications, additions, and changes accepted by the Institute of Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA)
    as formulated by a joint project of the two organizations. IEEE/EIA 12207.0 contains
    concepts and guidelines to foster better understanding and application of the
    standard. Thus this standard provides industry a basis for software practices
    that would be usable for both national and international business.
