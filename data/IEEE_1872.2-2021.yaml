abstract:
- content: This standard extends IEEE Std 1872-2015, IEEE Standard for Ontologies
    for Robotics and Automation, to represent additional domain-specific concepts,
    definitions, and axioms commonly used in Autonomous Robotics (AuR). This standard
    is general and can be used in many ways--for example, to specify the domain knowledge
    needed to unambiguously describe the design patterns of AuR systems; to represent
    AuR system architectures in a unified way; or as a guideline to build autonomous
    systems consisting of robots operating in various environments.
