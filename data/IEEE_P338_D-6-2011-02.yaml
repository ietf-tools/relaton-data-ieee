abstract:
- content: The standard provides criteria for the performance of periodic surveillance
    testing of nuclear power generating station safety systems. The scope of periodic
    surveillance testing consists of functional tests and checks, calibration verification,
    and time response measurements, as required, to verify that the safety system
    performs its defined safety function. Post maintenance and post-modification testing
    are not covered by this document. This standard amplifies the periodic surveillance
    testing requirements of other nuclear safety-related IEEE standards.
