abstract:
- content: This International Standard IEC/IEEE 62704-3 describes the concepts, techniques,
    benchmark phone models, validation procedures, uncertainties and limitations of
    the finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique when used for determining the
    peak spatial-average specific absorption rate (SAR) in standardized head and body
    phantoms exposed to the electromagnetic fields generated by wireless communication
    devices, in particular mobile phones, in the frequency range from 30 MHz to 6
    GHz. It recommends and provides guidance on the numerical modeling of mobile phones
    and benchmark results to verif y the general approach for the numerical simulations
    of such devices. It defines acceptable modeling requirements, guidance on meshing
    and test positions of the mobile phone and the phantom models. This document will
    not recommend specific SAR limits since these are found in other documents, e.g.,
    IEEE C95.1-2005[1] and ICNIRP[2].
