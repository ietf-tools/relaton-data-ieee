abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1070-1995. A generic specification, including design and
    testing, is provided for transmission modular restoration structure components
    being widely used today by many electric utilities, both publicly and privately
    owned. It can be used by electric utilities for acquisition of transmission modular
    restoration structure components, to ensure that the particular design is compatible
    with structures presently in use within the industry. This would enhance transmission
    mutual aid. Testing is prescribed to provide a high confidence level between manufacturers
    and/or suppliers and to promote competitive acquisition practices within the industry.
