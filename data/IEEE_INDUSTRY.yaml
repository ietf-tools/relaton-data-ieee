abstract:
- content: This white paper reviews the current standards landscape for three-dimensional
    body scanning, body landmarking, and measuring. International standards are compared
    and recommendations are made for a minimal set of landmarks and measurements (L&amp;M)
    needed for several industrial use cases of 3D Body Processing such as fit and
    size estimation, retail, clothing manufacturing, CAD tool developers, and body
    model storage and service.
