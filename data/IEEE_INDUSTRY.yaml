abstract:
- content: This white paper examines the development of a personalized digital last
    and the impact on the role of footwear technicians. As the personalized digital
    last becomes the basis of future footwear production, the role of footwear technicians
    may expand to include a broader definition of fit, maintaining libraries of different
    lasts, and maintaining quality safeguards for mass customized of footwear. Though
    this paper focuses on women’s footwear, the issue of fit is universal for men,
    women, and children. The techniques described in this paper, can be utilized for
    most footwear segments.
