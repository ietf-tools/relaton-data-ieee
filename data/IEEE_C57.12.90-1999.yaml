abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.12.90-2006 A common format for data files and
    exchange medium used for the interchange of vari- ous types of fault, test, or
    simulation data for electrical power systems is defined. Sources of transient
    data are described, and the case of diskettes as an exchange medium is recommended.Issues
    of sampling rates, filters, and sample rate conversions for transient data being
    exchanged are discussed. Files for data exchange are specified, as is the organization
    of the data. A sample file is given.
