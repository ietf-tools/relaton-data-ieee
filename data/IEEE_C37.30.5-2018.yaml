abstract:
- content: 'The terms and definitions covered in this standard refer to all high -voltage
    enclosed and non-enclosed, indoor and outdoor air switches rated in excess of
    1000 V used primarily in connection with generation, transmission, distribution,
    and conversion of electric power. This includes such switch types as disconnect,
    horn gap, fault initiation, and ground for manual or power operation. The following
    switch types are not covered by this standard: distribution cutouts fitted with
    disconnecting blades, and switches used in metal enclosed and pad mounted switchgear.
    This standard also does not apply to load break separable insulated connectors,
    circuit breakers, circuit switchers, or reclosers.'
