abstract:
- content: This standard (IEEE P2668) defines the maturity index of Internet-of-things
    (IoT), referred to as IDex. It specifies (1) the formats for the IoT Maturity
    Index (IDex); (2) the IDex database and the IDex evaluation model database. It
    also defines the general mechanism of the IDex evaluation pertinent to the applications
    and technical fields of the IoT objects to be evaluated. The IDex can be applied
    to IoT devices, networks, applications, algorithms, hardware, software, systems,
    and infrastructure. With slight modifications, the IDex can be extended to evaluate
    objects and infrastructure in various services, such as smart city services.
