abstract:
- content: The standard identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data storage for
    archiving and developing data sharing platforms, and application units as important
    system components for developing digital communities, i.e., building-scale and
    city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure. The standard defines
    a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways,
    storage, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks. This enables integration
    of multiple facilities, data storage, application services such as central management,
    energy saving, environmental monitoring, and alarm notification systems.
