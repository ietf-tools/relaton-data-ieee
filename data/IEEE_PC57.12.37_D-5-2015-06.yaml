abstract:
- content: This standard provides a basis for the electronic reporting of transformer
    test data on liquid immersed distribution transformers as defined in the IEEE
    C57.12.2X, C57.12.3X and C57.12.4X standards series. The specific set of test
    data to be reported, and the report format, is detailed along with an extended
    set of data as an option for the user.
