abstract:
- content: Reuse of test data and test structures developed for individual cores (designs)
    when integrated into larger integrated circuits is required for system-on-chip
    (SoC) tests. This standard defines language constructs sufficient to represent
    the context of a memory core and of the integration of that memory core into an
    SoC. This facilitates the development and reuse of test and repair mechanisms
    for memories. This standard also defines constructs that represent the test structures
    internal to the memory core for reuse in the creation of the tests for the logic
    outside the memory core. Semantic rules are defined for the language to facilitate
    interoperability between different entities (the memory core provider, the system
    integrator, and the automation tool developer) involved in the creation of an
    SoC. The capabilities are an extension of IEEE Std 1450.6<sup>TM</sup>-2005. As
    a result of this extension, CTLs limitations of handling memories are addressed.
