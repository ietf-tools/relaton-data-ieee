abstract:
- content: Suggestions on application, installation, operation, and maintenance are
    presented as an aid to obtaining satisfactory performance from indoor and outdoor
    high-voltage air disconnecting and load interrupter switches rated in excess of
    1000 V ac. It is assumed that properly designed and maintained supporting structures
    are provided for the disconnecting equipment, taking into account such factors
    as location, soil conditions, wind and ice loadings, seismic considerations, and
    mechanical loads, including electromagnetic forces imposed by the switches, buses,
    or other equipment mounted thereon.
