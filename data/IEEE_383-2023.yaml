abstract:
- content: General requirements and methods for qualifying electric cables, and splices
    for nuclear facilities are provided in this standard. Cable, wire, and splices
    within or integral to other devices (e.g., instruments, panels, motors) should
    be qualified using the requirements in the applicable device standard or IEEE/IEC
    Std 60780-323&#8482;:2016. However, the requirements set in this standard may
    be applied to the cable and splices within these devices. For qualification of
    fiber optic cable, refer to IEEE Std 1682&#8482;.
