abstract:
- content: The procedures to be used by manufacturers in testing direct and indirect
    reading quartz fiber pocket dosimeters for measuring X-ray and gamma-ray exposure
    are defined. The standard covers equipment requirements, test requirements, inspection
    for workmanship, charging and reading, physical tests, tests of radiation response
    under standard and extreme environmental conditions, and energy dependence and
    geometrical considerations. The intent is to ensure that each dosimeter meets
    the requisite standards of performance and workmanship as specified in ANSI N13.5-1972,
    Performance Specifications for Direct Reading and Indirect Reading Pocket Dosimeters
    for X and Gamma Radiation, and conforms to the certification for that model provided
    to the user. The user is encouraged to perform certain of the inspections and
    tests at intervals considered appropriate for the specific applications.
