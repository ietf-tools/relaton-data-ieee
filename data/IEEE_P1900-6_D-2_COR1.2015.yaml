abstract:
  content: This corrigendum to IEEE Std 1900.6TM-2011 modifies terms and definitions
    in response to comments received during the approval process of the IEEE Std 1900.1aTM-2012
    and the IEEE Std 1900.6aTM-2014 that could not be considered in the 1900.6a. These
    corrections align the use of terms and definitions in the 1900.6 with their use
    in scope of the 1900.1 standard.
