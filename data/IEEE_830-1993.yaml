abstract:
- content: The content and qualities of a good software requirements specification
    (SRS) are described and several sample SRS outlines are presented. This recommended
    practice is aimed at specifying requirements of software to be developed but also
    can be applied to assist in the selection of in-house and commercial software
    products.
