abstract:
- content: 'Service conditions, ratings, interchangeable construction features, and
    tests for load-break and dead-break separable insulated connector systems rated
    601 V and above, 600 A or less, for use on power distribution systems, are established.
    Included are: corona voltage-level tests, dielectric tests, short-time current
    test, switching test, fault-closure test, current-cycling tests, accelerated sealing-life
    test, cable pull-out test, operating-force test, operating-eye test, test-point
    cap test, test-point tests, and shielding test.'
