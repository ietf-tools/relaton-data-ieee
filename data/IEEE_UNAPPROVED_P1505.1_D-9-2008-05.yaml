abstract:
- content: This trial-use standard, IEEE 1505.1 The Common Test Interface Pin Map
    Configuration for High-Density, Single-Tier Electronics Test Requirements Utilizing
    IEEE Std 1505 represents an extension to the IEEE-1505 Receiver Fixture Interface
    (RFI) Standard Specification. Particular emphasis is placed on defining within
    the IEEE-1505 RFI Standard a more specific set of performance requirements that
    employ a common scalable (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific connector modules;
    (c) respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation; and (e) legacy
    ATE transitional devices. This is intentionally done to standardize the footprint
    and assure mechanical and electrical interoperability between past and future
    Automatic Test Systems (ATS).
