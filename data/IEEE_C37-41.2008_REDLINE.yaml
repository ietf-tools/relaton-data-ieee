abstract:
  content: 'Required procedures for performing design tests for high-voltage distribution
    class and power class fuses, as well as for fuse-disconnecting switches and enclosed
    single-pole air switches, are specified. These design tests, as appropriate to
    a particular device, include the following test types: dielectric, interrupting,
    load-break, radio-influence, short-time current, temperature rise, time-current,
    manual operation, thermal-cycle, bolt torque, and liquid tightness.'
