abstract:
- content: Methods for sizing both vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries
    used with terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) systems are described. The purpose of
    this document is to assist system designers in sizing batteries for residential,
    commercial, and industrial PV systems. Iterative techniques to optimize battery
    costs, installation, maintenance, safety, testing procedures and consideration
    of battery types other than lead-acid, are beyond the scope of this document.
    Recommended practices for the remainder of the electrical systems associated with
    PV installations are also beyond the scope of this document.
