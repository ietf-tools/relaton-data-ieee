abstract:
- content: A rating structure for AC high-voltage circuit breakers rated on a symmetrical
    current basis is established. The rating structure applies to indoor and outdoor
    types of AC high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V. Service conditions,
    construction, and nameplate markings are also considered.
