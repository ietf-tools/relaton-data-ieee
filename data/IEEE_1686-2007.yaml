abstract:
- content: The functions and features to be provided in substation intelligent electronic
    devices (lEDs) to accommodate critical infrastructure protection programs are
    defined in this standard. Security regarding the access, operation, configuration,
    firmware revision, and data retrieval from an IED is addressed in this standard.
    Communications for the purpose of power system protection (teleprotection) is
    not addressed. Encryption for the secure transmission of data both within and
    external to the substation, including supervisory control and data acquisition,
    is not part of this standard as this is addressed in other efforts.
