abstract:
- content: Advice is given for cloud computing ecosystem participants (cloud vendors,
    service providers, and users) of standards-based choices in areas such as application
    interfaces, portability interfaces, management interfaces, interoperability interfaces,
    file formats, and operation conventions. These choices are grouped into multiple
    logical profiles, which are organized to address different cloud roles.
