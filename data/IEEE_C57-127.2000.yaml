abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to the detection and location of acoustic emissions
    from partial discharges and other sources in oil immersed power transformers and
    reactors. It is intended to provide a means of associating the relative magnitude
    and position of partial discharges and other sources with the acoustic signals
    obtained by strategically located transducers.
