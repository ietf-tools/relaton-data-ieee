abstract:
- content: This guide is primarily concerned with outdoor AC substatons, either air-insulated
    or gas-insulated. Distribution, transmission and power plant substations are covered
    by this guide. The intent of the guide is to provide guidance and information
    pertinent to the basic design of a substation ground grid, safe limits of potential
    differences that can exist in a substation under fault conditions between points
    that can be contacted by a human body. This guide is primarily concerned with
    safe grounding practices for power frequencies in the 50-60 Hz range.
