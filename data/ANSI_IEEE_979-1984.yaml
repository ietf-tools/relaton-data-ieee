abstract:
- content: 'Substation fire-protection practices that generally have been accepted
    by the electric utility industry and existing fire- protection standards and guides
    that may aid in the design of components are identified. The purpose is to give
    design guidance to the substation engineer in the area of fire protection. The
    following are covered: control and relay buildings; transformers; separation and
    location of oil-filled equipment; cable installation; fire detection systems;
    fire extinguishing systems; substation components; indoor substations; and fire
    fighting'
