abstract:
- content: In this guide is the application of Damped AC (DAC) for field testing 1
    of power cables isdescribed. DAC voltage withstand testing and diagnostic tests
    and measurements that areperformed in combination with DAC voltage application
    in the field on shielded power cablesystems are discussed. Whenever possible,
    cable systems are treated in a similar manner toindividual cables. Tables and
    figures are included to show the effectiveness of the DAC acvoltage test, the
    diagnostic evaluation and the user experiences in the past years for field testing
    of different medium and (extra) high voltage cable system.
