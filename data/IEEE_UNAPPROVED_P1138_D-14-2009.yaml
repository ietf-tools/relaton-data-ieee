abstract:
- content: This standard covers the performance, test requirements, procedures and
    acceptance criteria for a transmission line overhead ground wire (a.k.a. shield
    wire,static wire,earth wire,skywire) with optical fibers commonly known as Optical
    Ground Wire (OPGW). An OPGW cable has the dual performance functions of a ground
    wire with telecommunicatons capabilities. This standard includes functional requirements
    such as electrical,mechanical,optical fiber,environmental and packaging; test
    requirements related to design, installation,in-service, maintenance, including
    routine tests. This standard is not intended to supersede any established safety
    rules,codes,regulations or practices associated with the use of OPGW cables.It
    is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety
    and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations
    prior to use.
