abstract:
- content: The problems of system grounding, that is, connection to ground of neutral,
    of the corner of the delta, or of the midtap of one phase, are covered. The advantages
    and disadvantages of grounded versus ungrounded systems are discussed. Information
    is given on how to ground the system, where the system should be grounded, and
    how to select equipment for the grounding of the neutral circuits. Connecting
    the frames and enclosures of electric apparatus, such as motors, switchgear, transformers,
    buses, cables conduits, building frames, and portable equipment, to a ground system
    is addressed. The fundamentals of making the interconnection or ground-conductor
    system between electric equipment and the ground rods, water pipes, etc. are outlined.
    The problems of static electricity&#8212;how it is generated, what processes may
    produce it, how it is measured, and what should be done to prevent its generation
    or to drain the static charges to earth to prevent sparking&#8212;are treated.
    Methods of protecting structures against the effects of lightning are also covered.
    Obtaining a low-resistance connection to the earth, use of ground rods, connections
    to water pipes, etc. is discussed. A separate chapter on sensitive electronic
    equipment is included.
