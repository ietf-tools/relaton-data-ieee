abstract:
- content: This standard describes methods for measuring ther performance of uniformly
    coded alnalog-to-digital (A/D) coverters and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters
    for pulse code modulation (PSM) television video signals. Excluded are A/D and
    D/A converters that employ nonlinear processes for bit reduction television circuits,
    as for example, sub-Nyquist encoding, differential PCM, transform coders, etc.
    This standard is intended primarily for CCIR System M, 525-line/60-field television
    circuits. The performance to be measured should be relevant to the subjective
    quality of the television picture. Measurements not related to the quality of
    the video signal are excluded from this standard. Where possible, television type
    test signals are used to accomodate clamping circuits in the converters.
