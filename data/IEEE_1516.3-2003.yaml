abstract:
- content: The processes and procedures that should be followed by users of the High
    Level Architecture (HLA)to develop and execute federations are de .ned in this
    recommended practice.This recommended practice is not intended to replace low-level
    management and systems engineering practices native to HLA user organizations,but
    is rather intended as a higher-level framework into which such practices can be
    integrated and tailored for specific uses.
