abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 1284, 2000 Edition A signaling method for asynchronous,
    fully interlocked, bidirectional parallel communications between hosts and printers
    or other peripherals is defined. A format for a peripheral identification string
    and a method of returning this string to the host outside of the bidirectional
    data stream is also specified.
