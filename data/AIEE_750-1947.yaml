abstract:
- content: Preparation of material incorporated in this report has been undertaken
    by the AIEE in the belief that it will materially aid in the realization of a
    better aircraft electric system. This conviction is confirmed by opinions expressed
    in joint meetings, including representation from SAE, NASC, NEMA, Army Air Forces,
    and the Bureau of Aeronautics.
