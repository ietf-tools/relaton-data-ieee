abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a common framework for making an abstract model of personal health
    data available in transport-independent transfer syntax required to establish
    logical connections between systems and to provide presentation capabilities and
    services needed to perform communication tasks is described in this standard.
    The protocol is optimized to personal health usage requirements and leverages
    commonly used methods and tools wherever possible.
