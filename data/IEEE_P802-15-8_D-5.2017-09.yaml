abstract:
- content: An application guide for the design, installation, testing, commissioning
    and maintenance of skin effect trace heating systems for pipelines, vessels, equipment,
    and structures intended for use in general industrial applications are provided
    in this standard. This standard provides requirements when utilizing skin effect
    trace heating systems in ordinary as well as hazardous areas having potentially
    explosive atmospheres.

- content: Physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) mechanisms are defined
    in this standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) peer aware communications
    (PAC) optimized for peer-to-peer and infrastructure-less communications with fully
    distributed coordination. PAC features include discovery for peer information
    without association, discovery signaling rate typically greater than 100 kb/s,
    discovery of the number of devices in the network, scalable data transmission
    rates typically up to 10 Mb/s, group communications with simultaneous membership
    in multiple groups typically up to 10, relative positioning, security, and operation
    in selected globally available unlicensed/licensed bands below 11 GHz capable
    of supporting these requirements.
