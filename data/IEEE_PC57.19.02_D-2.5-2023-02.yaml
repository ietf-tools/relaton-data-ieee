abstract:
- content: This standard covers electrical, mechanical, dimensional, and related requirements
    for non-condenser bushings used in liquid-immersed distribution transformers covered
    by IEEE Std C57.12.20&#8482;, IEEE Std C57.12.34&#8482;, IEEE Std C57.12.36&#8482;,
    and IEEE Std C57.12.38&#8482; and that have basic impulse insulation levels (BILs)
    of less than or equal to 200 kV. These requirements are to be interpreted, measured,
    or tested in accordance with IEEE Std C57.19.00&#8482; unless otherwise stated
    in this standard.
