abstract:
- content: Replaced by 1120-2004. IEEE Std 1120-1990, IEEE Guide to the Factors to
    Be Considered in the Planning, Design, and Installation of Submarine Power and
    Communications Cables, provides a checklist of factors to be considered in the
    planning, design, and installation of power and communications cables in a submarine
    environment. It does not attempt to provide complete cable design criteria.
