abstract:
- content: This standard defines a method for incorporating more than one source of
    control into a CAMAC crate. The standard fully conforms to the mechanical and
    signal standards of the CAMAC system as described in ANSI/IEEE Std 583-1975, Modular
    Instrumentation and Digital Interface System (CAMAC), or EUR 4100e. In order to
    allow more than one Controller to access the Dataway of a CAMAC Crate, an Auxiliary
    Controller Bus (ACE) and priority arbitration protocol are fully defined. This
    permits the use of Auxiliary Controllers (ACs) in normal stations in the crate.
    The ACB carries encoded address information from an AC to the Crate Controller
    (CC) in the control station of a CAMAC crate, and carries Look-at- Me signals
    from the CC to the ACs. The ACB, connected between controllers, may also be used
    to establish priority for control of the CAMAC Dataway. This standard is fully
    compatible with ANSI/ IEEE Std 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface System (CAMAC),
    or EUR 6100e, and the ANSIAEEE Std 596-1976, Parallel Highway Interface System
    (CAMAC) or EUR 4600e. It may also be used in autonomous systems (systems with
    no external highways) or in systems with Type U Crate Controllers (such as systems
    with a computer I/O bus as the highway).
