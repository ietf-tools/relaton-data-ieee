abstract:
- content: Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic
    characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets and headsets are covered
    in this standard. The methods may also be applicable to a wide variety of other
    communications equipment, including cordless, wireless and mobile communications
    devices. Measurement results may be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized
    basis. Application is in the frequency range from 100 to 8,500 Hz. This edition
    incorporates IEEE 269a-2007, "IEEE Std. for Methods for Measuring Transmission
    Performance of Analog and Digital Telephone Sets, Handsets, and Headsets, Amendment
    1." Other substantive changes have been made since the 2002 edition
