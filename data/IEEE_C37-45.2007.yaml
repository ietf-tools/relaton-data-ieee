abstract:
- content: IEEE specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution class
    enclosed single-pole air switches and associated accessories with rated voltages
    from 1 kV through 8.3 kV are established. All of these devices are intended for
    use on alternating current distribution systems. These include distribution class
    enclosed single-pole air switches, supports, mountings, fuse hooks, and tongs,
    all of the type used exclusively with distribution class enclosed single-pole
    air switches, and distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches used in
    enclosure packages.
