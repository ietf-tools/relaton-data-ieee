abstract:
- content: This guide contains general and specific recommendations fo 1 r grounding
    current and voltage transformer secondary circuits and cases of connected equipment.
    Although most diagrams included in this guide show relaying applications, the
    recommended practices apply equally to metering and other areas where instrument
    transformers are used. The guide includes grounding practices presently used and
    practices that were not previously reported. Specifically, a review of other than
    North American grounding practices is included.
