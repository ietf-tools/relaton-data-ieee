abstract:
- content: A test procedure for impulse testing of insulated conductors (cables) and
    cables with accessories installed (cable systems) is provided. This procedure
    can be used as a design or qualification test for cables or for cable systems.
    This test procedure is not intended to replace any existing or future standards
    covering cable or cable accessories, impulse generators, impulse testing or voltage
    measurements. It is intended to supplement such standards by indicating specific
    procedures for a specific type of cable system or cable system component.
