abstract:
- content: Technical background and application details to support understanding of
    IEEE Std 1547&#8482;-2018 are provided. The guide facilitates the use of IEEE
    Std 1547&#8482;-2018 by characterizing various forms of distributed energy resource
    (DER) technologies and their associated interconnection issues. It provides background
    and rationale of the technical requirements of IEEE Std 1547&#8482;-2018. It also
    provides tips, techniques, and common practices to addresses issues related to
    DER project implementation. This guide is intended for use by engineers, engineering
    consultants, and knowledgeable individuals in the field of DER. The IEEE 1547
    series of standards is cited in the Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, and this
    guide is one document in the IEEE 1547 series.
