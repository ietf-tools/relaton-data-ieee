abstract:
- content: The HLA has been developed to provide a common architecture for distributed
    modeling and simulation. The HLA defines an integrated approach that provides
    a common framework for the interconnection of interacting simulations. This document,
    the second in a family of three related HLA documents, defines the standard services
    of and interfaces to the HLA Runtime Infrastructure (RTI). These services are
    used by the interacting simulations to achieve a coordinated exchange of information
    when they participate in a distributed federation. The standards contained in
    this architecture are interrelated and need to be considered as a product set,
    when changes are made. They each have value independently.
