abstract:
- content: Three-phase and single-phase AC synchronous and induction electric motors
    in ratings 0.18 kW (1/4 hp) and larger are covered in this guide. Primary emphasis
    is on the use of open or nonexplosionproof or nonflameproof enclosed motors in
    Class I, Division 2 and Class I, Zone 2 locations as covered in NFPA 70-2011.
    Surface temperature test methods and sine wave and non-sine wave applications
    are covered. Precautions against excessive surface temperatures and sparking are
    included. To mitigate hot surface temperatures and sparking, this document provides
    guidance for selecting, operating, and maintaining motors in Class I, Division
    2 and Class I, Zone 2 locations. This guide does not cover AC wound rotor motors
    and DC electric motors. Motors installed in locations other than Class I, Division
    2 and Class I, Zone 2 as covered in NFPA 70-2011 are not covered in this guide.
    This document is not a specification and is not intended to be used as a specification
    for purchasing motors. The voltage breaks in this document are 1000 V and less,
    and over 1000 V.
