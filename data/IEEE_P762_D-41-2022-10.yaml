abstract:
- content: This document standardizes terminology and indexes for reporting electric
    generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity performance measures
    while recognizing the power industry’s needs, including marketplace competition.
    This standard also includes equations for equivalent demand forced outage rate
    (EFORd), newly identified outage states, energy weighted equations for group performance
    indexes, definitions of outside management control (OMC), pooling methodologies,
    and time-based calculations for group performance indexes. It includes consideration
    of Variable Energy Resource Units and Resource Unavailability and new indexes
    appropriate for that purpose.
