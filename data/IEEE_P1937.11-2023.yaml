abstract:
- content: The acquisition, organization, storage, and display of data from any earth
    observation system are all in polar coordinates (longitude and latitude), but
    at present there is no standard on polar coordinate based photogrammetric processing
    and analysis of this data especially for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). As we
    know, images are represented and processed in Euclidean coordinates. This is despite
    the fact that the photogrammetric process requires projective geometry rather
    than Euclidean geometry. Projective geometry introduces the concept of a projection
    center &#8211; referred to as a pole &#8211; that is well-defined in polar coordinate
    system. Hence, the use of polar coordinates in photogrammetry (polar coordinate
    photogrammetry) fits better for geometric operations and avoids error propagation
    during coordinate conversions during acquisition, processing, management, and
    storage. At present there is no technical standard on the use of polar photogrammetry
    especially for imagery acquired by UAS; the remote sensing technicians lack unified
    technical specifications when operating with UAS images in polar coordinates which
    often reduces the quality of photogrammetric products. Generating the technical
    specifications for polar coordinate photogrammetry will ensure data quality, improve
    photogrammetric process efficiency, and offer better services for remote sensing
    applications. More importantly, the establishment of polar coordinate photogrammetry
    standard will unify the whole procedures of digital earth models from acquisition
    to processing and then to organization and storage in polar coordinate system.
