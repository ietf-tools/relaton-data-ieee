abstract:
- content: This International Standard specifies the minimal requirements for the
    structure and contents of an assurance case. An assurance case includes a top-level
    claim (or set of claims) for a property of a system or product, systematic argumentation
    regarding this claim, and the evidence and explicit assumptions that underlie
    this argumentation. Arguing through multiple levels of subordinate claims, this
    structured argumentation connects the top-level claim to the evidence and assumptions.
    Stakeholders can evaluate the assurance case to determine the extent of achievement
    of the top-level claim by the system or product and whether this achievement is
    shown within the allowable uncertainty or risk and any related consequences. The
    results regarding the top-level claim and its support along with related uncertainties
    and consequences constitute a basis for rationally managing risk, achieving grounds
    for appropriate confidence, and aiding in decision making.
