abstract:
- content: Circuitry that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the
    test, maintenance, and support of assembled printed circuit boards is defined.
    The circuitry includes a standard interface through which instructions and test
    data are communicated. A set of test features is defined, including a boundary-scan
    register, such that the component is able to respond to a minimum set of instructions
    designed to assist with testing of assembled printed circuit boards.
