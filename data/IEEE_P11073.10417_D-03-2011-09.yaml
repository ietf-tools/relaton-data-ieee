abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of communication
    between personal telehealth glucose meter devices and compute engines (e.g. cell
    phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, and set top boxes) in
    a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate
    portions of existing standards, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information
    models, application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies the
    use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments
    restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This
    standard defines a common core of communication functionality for personal telehealth
    glucose meters.
