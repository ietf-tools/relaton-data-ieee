abstract:
- content: A common framework for extending the system and software life cycle processes
    of IEEE Std 12207-2008 to include the systematic practice of reuse is provided.
    This standard specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to be applied during
    each phase of the life cycle to enable a system and/or product to be constructed
    from reusable assets. It also specifies the processes, activities, and tasks to
    enable the identification, construction, maintenance, and management of assets
    supplied.
