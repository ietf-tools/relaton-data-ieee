abstract:
- content: Amendment 1 addresses an observation made by a user of the standard. The
    observation raised a concern that misunderstandings may occur due to the common
    use of &#x201C;tn&#x201D; for otherre calculations. To address the concern, &#x201C;tn&#x201D;
    was changed to &#x201C;p&#x201D;. The value for the number of trials used in the
    standard remains the same.
