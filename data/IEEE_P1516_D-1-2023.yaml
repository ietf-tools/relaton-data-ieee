abstract:
- content: This standard, describing the framework and rules of the High Level Architecture
    (HLA), is the capstone document for a family of related HLA standards. It defines
    the HLA, its components, and the rules that outline the responsibilities of HLA
    federates and federations to ensure a consistent implementation. Simulations are
    abstractions of the real world, and no one simulation can solve all of the functional
    needs for the modeling and simulation community. It is anticipated that technology
    advances will allow for new and different modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) implementations
    within the framework of the HLA. The standards contained in this architecture
    are interrelated and need to be considered as a product set, as a change in one
    is likely to have an impact on the others. As such, the HLA is an integrated approach
    that has been developed to provide a common architecture for simulation.
