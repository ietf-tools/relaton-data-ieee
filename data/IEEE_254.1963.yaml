abstract:
- content: While the term parametric amplifier implies a device which operates by
    virtue of the variation of some parameter, resistive or reactive, current usage
    applies it to circuits in which only a reactance is varied. When applied to electron
    beam devices and devices employing distributed nonlinear media, the variable parameter
    is equivalent to a reactance in the sense that it is associated with energy storage
    rather than eiiergy dissipative properties of the beam or medium. The qualifier,
    reactance, is more frequently applied to circuits in which the variable element
    is an easily identified lumped reactance. The qualifier, parametric, is more frequently
    applied to electron beam and distributed parameter devices, but can include the
    variable reactance devices as well. Thus in any of the following definitions,
    reactance may be used in place of parametric. These definitions are intended to
    exclude devices which operate by virtue of variable resistance or negative resistance.
