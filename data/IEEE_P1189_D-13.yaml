abstract:
- content: This guide describes methods for selecting the appropriate type of valve-regulated,
    immobilized-electrolyte, recombinant lead-acid battery for any of a variety of
    stationary float applications. Installation, maintenance, sizing, and consideration
    of battery types other than valve- regulated lead-acid batteries, are beyond the
    scope of this guide. Design of the dc system and sizing of the dc battery charger(s)
    are also beyond the scope of this guide.
