abstract:
  content: Aiding in the comprehension and use of IEEE VHDL, this unique product offers
    a comprehensive &amp; reliable tutorial on VHDL - not available anywhere else.
    An enhancement to IEEE Std 1076-1993, the interactive tutorial is organized into
    four modules designed to incrementally add to the user's understanding of VHDL
    and it's applications. This hands-on tutorial shows clear links between the many
    levels and layers of VHDL and provides actual examples of VHDL implementation,
    making it an indispensible tool for VHDL product development and users.
