abstract:
- content: 'In the dc electric railways, when a train regenerates power, usually the
    power has to be consumed within the dc network because the dc traction power systems
    are often not reversible. Several technologies improve receptivity: energy consumption,
    energy feedback, and energy storage. Solution selection depends on the application.
    The energy feedback systems (EFSs) convert energy to ac power system as system
    dc voltage rises. Engineers are helped by this guide to decide where these EFSs
    can provide the greatest benefits, determine which design solutions will have
    the maximum effectiveness, and evaluate the costs and benefits of developing new
    EFS projects.'
