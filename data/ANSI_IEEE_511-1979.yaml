abstract:
- content: This standard describes methods for measuring the linear waveform distortions
    of TV video signals, that is, distortions which are caused by amplitude-independent
    (linear) transmission characteristics of television equipment and facilities.
    The primary application of this standard is for routine operational and maintenance
    tests, where rapid interpretation of test results is desirable. The techniques
    described here may also be applicable to laboratory measurements, and detailed
    mainteance procedures.
