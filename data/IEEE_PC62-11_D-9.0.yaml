abstract:
- content: Metal-oxide surge arresters (MOSAs) designed to repeatedly limit the voltage
    surges on 48 Hz to 62 Hz power circuits (&#x003E;1000 V) by passing surge discharge
    current and automatically limiting the flow of system power current are addressed
    in this standard. This standard applies to devices for separate mounting and to
    devices supplied integrally with other equipment. The tests demonstrate that an
    arrester is able to survive the rigors of reasonable environmental conditions
    and system phenomena while protecting equipment and/or the system from damaging
    overvoltages caused by lightning, switching, and other undesirable surges.
