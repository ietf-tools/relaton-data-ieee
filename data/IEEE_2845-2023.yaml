abstract:
- content: This standard is applicable to celebratory balloons that are comparable
    in size and shape to what are commonly referred to as foil balloons and are available
    in retail stores and filled with helium or a lighter-than-air gas. The dielectric
    performance of celebratory balloons in contact with simulated energized overhead
    distribution power lines with the intent of minimizing balloon-caused power system
    outages (or electrical faults) are evaluated by the test procedures. The scope
    is limited to distribution system voltages of 38 kV or less and only single balloons.
    The effects of having any moisture, contaminants, or string or ribbon attachments
    to the balloon(s) are not investigated under this procedure.
