abstract:
- content: 'This trial-use standard represents an extension to the IEEE 1505 receiver
    fixture interface (RFI) standard specification. Particular emphasis is placed
    on defining within the IEEE 1505 RFI standard a more specific set of performance
    requirements that employ a common scalable: (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific
    connector modules; (c) respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation;
    and (e) legacy automatic test equipment (ATE) transitional devices. This is intentionally
    done to standardize the footprint and assure mechanical and electrical interoperability
    between past and future automatic test systems (ATS).'
