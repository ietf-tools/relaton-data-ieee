abstract:
- content: Modern broadcast radio receivers of the superheterodyne type are frequently
    sources of spurious radiation from the local oscillator, which radiation may cause
    severe interference with other services. In addition, in the case of television
    broadcast receivers, there may be radiation of power from other sources beside
    the local oscillator. In this standard the potential sources of spurious radiation
    from frequency modulation and television broadcast receivers are described and
    methods of measurement whereby the strength of some of these radiations may be
    determined are set up. Where the methods for the two classes of receivers differ,
    the specifications for each are outlined.<<ETX>>
