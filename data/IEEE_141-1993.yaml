abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the Color Books family. A thorough
    analysis of basic electrical-systems considerations is presented. Guidance is
    provided in design, construction, and continuity of an overall system to achieve
    safety of life and preservation of property; reliability; simplicity of operation;
    voltage regulation in the utilization of equipment within the tolerance limits
    under all load conditions; care and maintenance; and flexibility to permit development
    and expansion. Recommendations are made regarding system planning; voltage considerations;
    surge voltage protection; system protective devices; fault calculations; grounding;
    power switching, transformation, and motor-control apparatus; instruments and
    meters; cable systems; busways; electrical energy conservation; and cost estimation.
