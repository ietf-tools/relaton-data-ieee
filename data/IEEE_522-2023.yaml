abstract:
- content: 'Made in this guide are suggestions on testing the dielectric strength
    of the insulation separating the various turns from each other within multi-turn
    form-wound coils to determine the acceptability of the coils. Typical ratings
    of machines employing such coils normally lie within the range of 200 kW to 100
    MW. Test voltage levels described herein do not evaluate the ability of the turn
    insulation to withstand abnormal voltage surges, as contrasted to surges associated
    with normal operation. These suggestions apply to the following: a) Individual
    stator coils after manufacture b) Coils in completely wound stators of original
    manufacture c) Coils and windings for rewinds of used machinery d) Windings of
    machines in service to determine their suitability for further service (preventive-maintenance
    testing) The repetitive voltage surges (spikes) associated with Variable Frequency
    Drives (VFDs) are not addressed here.'
