abstract:
- content: This project defines a standard protocol for secure authentication and
    creation of trust between a secure host and a directly attached Transient and
    other Storage Devices, such as a USB flash drive, portable hard drive, or cellular
    phone. The protocol has only an indirect relationship with data integrity/security,
    and does not directly address issues of authorization and enforcement. The protocol
    also does not address devices that are attached using a network connection. However,
    a device that uses a point-to-point wireless connection such as WUSB may comply
    with this protocol.
