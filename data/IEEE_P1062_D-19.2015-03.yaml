abstract:
  content: This recommended practice describes a set of useful quality considerations
    that can be selected and applied during one or more steps in a software acquisition
    process. The recommended practices can be applied to software that runs on any
    computer system regardless of the size, complexity, or criticality of the software.
    The software supply chain may include integration of off-the-shelf (OTS), custom,
    or open source software. Each organization or individual using this recommended
    practice will need to identify the specific quality and activities that need to
    be included within its acquisition process.
