abstract:
- content: This standard was prepared to assist personnel responsible for maintenance
    painting of above-grade electrical support structures for electric utilities and
    large industrial facilities. The standard provides procedures to (1) assess structures
    for atmospheric corrosion; (2) assess the level of risk to the structure in terms
    of corrosion attack and degradation to the existing coating system; (3) make informed
    decisions based on those findings as to whether coating repair is needed, and
    if so, to what extent; and (4) apply repair coatings to the structure if applicable.
    This standard applies to the repair of above-grade atmospheric coatings and serves
    as a resource for preparing specifications to achieve the successful coating of
    utility structures.
