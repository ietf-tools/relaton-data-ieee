abstract:
- content: The maturity index of Internet-of-things (IoT ), referred to as IDex, is
    defined in this standard. The formats for 1) the IDex and 2) the IDex database
    and the IDex evaluation model database are specified. The general mechanism of
    the IDex evaluation is defined as pertinent to the applications and technical
    fields of the IoT objects to be evaluated. The IDex can be applied to IoT devices,
    networks, applications, algorithms, hardware, software, systems, and infrastructure.
    With slight modifications, the IDex can be extended to evaluate objects and infrastructure
    in various services, such as smart city services.
