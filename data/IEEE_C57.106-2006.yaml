abstract:
- content: Recommendations regarding oil tests and evaluation procedures are made
    in this guide; references are made to methods of reconditioning and reclaiming
    conventional petroleum (mineral) dielectric insulating oils; the levels at which
    these methods become necessary; and the routines for restoring oxidation resistance,
    where required, by the addition of oxidation inhibitors. The intent is to assist
    the power equipment operator in evaluating the serviceability of oil received
    in equipment, oil as received from the supplier for filling new equipment at the
    installation site, and oil as processed into such equipment; and to assist the
    operator in maintaining oil in serviceable condition. The mineral oil covered
    is used in transformers, reactors, circuit breakers, load tap changers, and voltage
    regulators.
