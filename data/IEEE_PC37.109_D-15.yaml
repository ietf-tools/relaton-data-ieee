abstract:
- content: The scope of the original standard was a guide for acceptable methods and
    configurations for the protection of shunt reactors. This PAR's intent is to make
    the existing guide more comprehensive by including reactor configurations and
    reactor protection schemes not now in the guide. Review and updating of the existing
    guide is needed to consider protection of shunt reactors with auxiliary power
    windings, improved turn-to-turn fault protection, use of digital/microprocessor
    relays and other items specific to shunt reactor protection as brought before
    the working group.
