abstract:
- content: The system architecture for a trusted data matrix, which includes business,
    functional, process, and technology requirements, are specified in this standard.
    Based on consensus-made requirements, agreements and management tools, the trusted
    data matrix is a data and resource sharing digital infrastructure to facilitate
    trusted, secure, transparent and accountable data sharing, exchanging, circulation
    and trading among different stakeholders.
