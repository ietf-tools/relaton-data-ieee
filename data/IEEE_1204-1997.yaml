- content: 'Guidance on the planning and design of dc links terminating at ac system
    locations having low Guidance on the planning and design of dc links terminating
    at ac system locations having lowshort-circuit capacities relative to the dc power
    infeed is provided in this guide. This guide is limited to the aspects of interactions
    between ac and dc systems that result from the fact that the ac system is weak
    compared to the power of the dc link (i.e., ac system appears as a high impedance
    at the ac/dc interface bus). This guide contains two parts: Part I, AC/DC Interaction
    Phenomena, classifies the strength of the ac/dc system, provides information about
    interactions between ac and dc systems, and gives guidance on design and performance;
    and Part II, Planning Guidelines, considers the impact of ac/dc system interactions
    and their mitigation on economics and overall system performance and discusses
    the studies that need to be performed.'
