abstract:
- content: A definition of terms is given, and the requirements and characteristics
    of testing apparatus are discussed. Test procedures for input measurements, output
    measurements, operating conditions, radio receiver adjustment, and performance
    tests are described. An appendix considers the design and use of the shielded
    test loop, the transmission-line method of testing loop receivers, and intermodulation
    distortion.<<ETX>>
