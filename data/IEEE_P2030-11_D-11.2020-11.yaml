abstract:
  content: A key concept and requirement for an operational and effective deployment
    of a large number of distributed energy resources (DER), which include sources
    of power and demand response, to enable the provision of flexibility and grid
    services, is the aggregation of DER. This aggregation function, as well as the
    functions required to enable grid services, are provided by DER management systems
    (DERMS). A functional specification for a DERMS and a description of the grid
    services that aggregated DER can provide the distribution and transmission systems
    is provided by this guide. Implementation issues and the interoperability requirements
    of a DERMS with its environment, including the transmission and distribution systems,
    and the communication and information infrastructure of modern grids are addressed
    by this guide.
