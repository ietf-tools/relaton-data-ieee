abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to be a basic or primary document that can be
    utilized and referenced by owners of AC motors and generators (machines) that
    need refurbishment, repair, and/or rewinding, as well as service or repair facilities.
    It has been developed for the Petroleum, Chemical and Process industries, and
    may be adapted to other areas of interest. The use of this standard is expected
    to result in higher quality and more cost effective, and timely repairs. It also
    provides a means of evaluating work performed and repair or service facilities.
