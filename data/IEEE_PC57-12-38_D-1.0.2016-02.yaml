abstract:
- content: An error has been identified in the 2014 published version of IEEE Std
    C57.12.38(TM). Two dimensions were provided for the high voltage bushing height
    above the base of the transformer. The lower dimension (597+114/-13) should have
    been designated as being for units 167 and 250 kVA only. This error needs to be
    corrected.
