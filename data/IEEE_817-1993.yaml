abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Mar 06, 2000. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. A test protocol and the performance criteria to determine the flame
    propagation tendency of flame-retardant coated cables in a vertical cable tray
    are covered. This standard applies to single and multiconductor cables. The test
    consists of exposing coated and uncoated cable samples to a theoretical 20 kW
    (70 000 Btu/hr) flame ignition source for a 20 min duration. The test facility,
    test sample requirements, test procedure, and evaluation of results are covered.'
