abstract:
- content: A set of metrics and methods to enable consistent measurement of the components
    of timing interval error in video synchronization signals is provided in this
    standard. By partitioning the spectra into regions of jitter and lower frequency
    wander (characterized as frequency offset and drift rate), timing performance
    can be better quantified for consistent control over nontraditional networks.
