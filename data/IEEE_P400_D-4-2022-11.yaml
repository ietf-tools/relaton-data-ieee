abstract:
- content: Various field test methods that are currently 1 available for or have been
    developed are listed in this guide. The guide covers shielded, insulated power
    cable systems rated 5 kV and above. The guide describes the tests and gives advantages
    and disadvantages, suggested applications, and typical results. Complete guides
    covering some of the test methods listed are available in the form of IEEE 400
    “point” documents
