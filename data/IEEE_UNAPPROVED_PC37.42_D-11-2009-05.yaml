abstract:
- content: Specifications for high voltage (above 1000 volts) expulsion type distribution
    class fuses, fuse cutouts, fuse disconnecting switches, their associated fuse
    links, disconnecting cutouts, and accessories for these devices are covered. All
    of these devices are intended for use on alternating current distribution systems.
    These include open and enclosed types of fuses and fuse cutouts and fuse disconnecting
    switches, as well as the fuse links of the type used exclusively with these devices;
    also open-link types of fuses, cutouts and their associated fuse links, open and
    enclosed types of disconnecting cutouts, fuse supports, fuse mountings and fuse
    hooks of the type used exclusively with distribution class fuses, fuse cutouts,
    fuse disconnecting switches and disconnecting cutouts, fuseholders and removable
    switch blades of the type used exclusively with distribution class fuse supports
    and mounting brackets used for distribution class equipment and other accessories.
