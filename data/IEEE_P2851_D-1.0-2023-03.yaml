abstract:
- content: A dependability lifecycle of products with focus on interoperable activities
    related to functional safety and its interactions with reliability, security,
    operational safety and time determinism are defined in this standard. The standard
    also describes methods, description languages, data models, and database schema
    that have been identified as necessary or critical, to enable the exchange/interoperability
    of data across all steps of the lifecycle encompassing activities executed at
    intellectual property (IP), system-on-chip (SoC), system and item levels, in a
    way that allows integration in different application domains such as automotive,
    industrial, medical and avionics safety critical systems.
