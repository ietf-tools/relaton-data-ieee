abstract:
- content: The development of dependable systems is rapidly growing due to the expansion
    of new applications such as automated driving or autonomous mobile robotics. Standards
    such as ISO 26262 (automotive https://www.iso.org/standard/68383.html), IEC 61508
    (https://www.iec.ch/functionalsafety/), and many others define the complete set
    of activities that need to be performed, requiring companies at different levels
    of the supply chain to tailor the lifecycle activities that apply to them and
    deliver results to other levels of the chain for which other requirements are
    applicable. However, currently, there are no common methods, languages, or formats
    to exchange the relevant data. As a result of this gap, companies are struggling
    with many different types of methods and description languages and are investing
    valuable time and effort to reconsolidate, compare, integrate, and combine the
    data. For this reason, the safety critical community is urgently asking for a
    solution to accelerate the safety engineering process while reducing risks and
    costs. The IEEE P2851 standardization initiative was started to define a dependability
    lifecycle as well as methods and formats for exchange/interoperability of data
    across all steps of the lifecycle in a consistent way. Additionally, the work
    products of this standardization initiative are expected to help enable interoperability
    between tools. The goal of this work is to provide structures and directions to
    allow a seamless exchange of information and interoperability between activities
    at the same or different level of abstraction, as well as activities across lifecycles
    related to different dependability attributes across application domains such
    as automotive, industrial, medical and avionics safety critical systems.
