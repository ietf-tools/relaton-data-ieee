abstract:
- content: This guide is primarily concerned with outdoor ac substations, either conventional
    or gas-insulated. These include distribution, transmission, and generating plant
    substations. With proper caution, the methods described herein are also applicable
    to indoor portions of such substations, or to substations that are wholly indoors.
    No attempt is made to cover the grounding problems peculiar to dc substations.
    A quantitative analysis of the effects of lightning surges isalso beyond the scope
    of this guide. (Incorporates IEEE Std P80-2013/Cor 1-2015).
