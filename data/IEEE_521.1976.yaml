abstract:
- content: Radar systems operate in frequency bands that since World War II have been
    identified by letter designations. Over a period of time these frequencies and
    their associated letter-band designations have been fixed by usage. In order to
    recognize and preserve accepted usage, this standard defines the letter-band nomenclature
    to be used as a convenience for describing the frequency in which radar operates.
    It should be cautioned that these are not a substitute for the specific frequency
    limits of a radar, nor is it meant that these letter bands be applied to other
    than radar.
