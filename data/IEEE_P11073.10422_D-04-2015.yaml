abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of communication between personal telehealth
    urine analyzer devices and compute engines (e.g., cell phones, personal computers,
    personal health appliances, and set top boxes) is established by this standard
    in a manner that enables plug-and play interoperability. Appropriate portions
    of existing standards are leveraged, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information
    models, application profile standards, and transport standards. The use of specific
    term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality
    in base frameworks in favor of interoperability is specified. A common core of
    communication functionality for personal telehealth urine analyzers is defined
    in this standard.
