abstract:
- content: The proper treatment of the electrical elements of the backplane that provides
    a physical and electrical connection between different modules in a computer system
    is covered. Techniques for measuring impedance, capacitance, and crosstalk are
    provided; and crosstalk, ground bounce, and decoupling are discussed. Relationships
    among the key elements controlling backplane performance, such as driver and receiver
    characteristics, the distance of the driver and receiver from the backplane, the
    impedance of the bus traces treated as transmission lines, lumped elements such
    as connectors and vias, and the termination are examined.
