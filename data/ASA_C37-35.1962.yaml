abstract:
- content: High voltage disconnecting switches are assigned certain ratings by the
    manufacturer and standard tests are conducted to assure the user that the switch,
    when new, will perform within the ratings shown on the nameplate. It should be
    recognized that the switch in service will perform within these ratings only if
    properly operated and maintained. It cannot be stressed too strongly that prescribed
    safety rules should be adhered to at all times when operating or maintaining high
    voltage disconnecting switches near energized equipment or conductors.
