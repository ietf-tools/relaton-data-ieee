abstract:
  content: 'Verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes are used to determine
    whether the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements
    of that activity and whether the product satisfies its intended use and user needs.
    V&amp;V life cycle process requirements are specified for different integrity
    levels. The scope of V&amp;V processes encompasses systems, software, and hardware,
    and it includes their interfaces. This standard applies to systems, software,
    and hardware being developed, maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-shelf
    (COTS), non-developmental items]. The term software also includes firmware and
    microcode, and each of the terms system, software, and hardware includes documentation.
    V&amp;V processes include the analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment,
    and testing of products. (NOTE: IEEE Std 1012-2016/Cor1-2017 was not published
    as an separate standard, but was incorporated into Std 1012&#8482;-2016 at publication)'
