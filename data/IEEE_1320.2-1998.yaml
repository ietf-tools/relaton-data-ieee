abstract:
- content: 'IDEF1X97 consists of two conceptual modeling languages. The key-style
    language supports data/information modeling and is downward compatible with the
    US government’s 1993 standard, FIPS PUB 184. The identity-style language is based
    on the object model with declarative rules and constraints.IDEF1X97 identity style
    includes constructs for the distinct but related components of object abstraction:
    interface, requests, and realization; utilizes graphics to state the interface;
    and defines a declarative, directly executable Rule and Constraint Language for
    requests and realizations. IDEF1X97 conceptual modeling supports implementation
    by relational databases, extended relational databases, object databases, and
    object programming languages. IDEF1X97 is formally defined in terms of first order
    logic. A procedure is given whereby any valid IDEF1X97 model can be transformed
    into an equivalent theory in first order logic. That procedure is then applied
    to a meta model of IDEF1X97 to define the valid set of IDEF1X97 models.'
