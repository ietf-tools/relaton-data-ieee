abstract:
- content: 'Polarimetric remote sensing is a new remote sensing observation method
    and a supplement to conventional remote sensing. It is effective at the ultraviolet,
    visible and infrared spectral regions for better monitoring of the earth. Different
    objects have different polarized characteristics, even different parts of the
    same objects show different polarized characteristics. As a result, at every band
    range (ultraviolet, visible and infrared) the UAV polarimetric remote sensing
    needs different sensors, different band setting, different data pre-processing
    procedures, even needs different recognition models for different earth object.
    Multiple parameters and diverse metrics create interoperability and data utilization
    problems unless standards are established in various aspects of polarimetric remote
    sensing for Earth observation systems. This standard specifies the basic definitions
    of terms in the UAV Earth observation polarimetric remote sensing task, and also
    specifies the basic process and method from three aspects: data acquisition preparation,
    data acquisition and correction, data processing and application. It also puts
    forward instructive suggestions in many specific dimensions, such as equipment
    status, parameter indicators, data calibration, data processing methods, etc.
    This standard will enable vendors to supply various components for Drone-based
    polarimetric remote sensing systems and to help ensure interoperability in operations
    and data utilization of polarimetric remote sensing deployed in earth observation
    systems.'
