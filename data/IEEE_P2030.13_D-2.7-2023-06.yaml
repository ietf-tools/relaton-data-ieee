abstract:
- content: This guide develops a functional specification for fast charging stations
    (FCS) for electric vehicles (EV) and electric transportation systems in general.
    The primary role of the FCS is to aggregate multiple fast chargers and local assets,
    and to coordinate their operation and energy management. The FCS may incorporate
    local distributed energy resources (DER), including renewable energy resources,
    such as solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, and other DER, such as battery energy
    storage systems and controllable loads. The inclusion of these resources allows
    the FCS to be configured as a microgrid. The guide develops the basic functional
    requirements for FCS control system as two sets of core functions, associated
    with an energy management system and a charge management system. The core functions
    include discovery and evaluation of charging requirements of EV batteries; monitoring
    and control of charging profiles; estimation of available and required energy;
    energy scheduling and management; electric power system interaction and power
    exchange management. Grid interconnection requirements, and grid and ancillary
    services provision, are addressed.
