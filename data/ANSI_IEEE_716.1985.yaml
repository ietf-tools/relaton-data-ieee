abstract:
- content: ANSI/IEEE Std 716-1985, Standard C/ATLAS, is an editorial revision and
    consolidation of C/ATLAS Test Language and C/ATLAS Syntax. C/ATLAS is a programming/programmable
    language which is a subset of IEEE Standard ATLAS Test Language with a specific
    and unique purpose. It has been developed to serve as the minimum ATLAS program
    requirements for use with specific equipment and systems. This single volume describes
    the language to be used for the writing of test programs for units under test
    (UUTs), so that these programs can operate on various makes and models of automatic
    test equipment (ATE). It includes the required portion which forms the core, or
    common basis, of all ATLAS subsets and the optional elements such as nouns, noun
    modifiers, and units. The single volume contains material explaining the formal
    syntax rules used, the actual formal syntax, and a thorough cross-referenced list,
    in alphabetical order, of syntax variables and symbols providing quick and easy
    reference to the different lexical symbols, rule names and literals which occur
    within the production rules.<<ETX>>
