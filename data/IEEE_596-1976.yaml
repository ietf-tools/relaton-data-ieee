abstract:
- content: The Dataway defined in IEEE Std 583-1975, Modular Instrumentation and Digital
    Interface System, is the basis for all CAMAC* systems. It provides the means of
    interconnection between modules and a crate controller within one crate. This
    standard defines the CAMAC Parallel Highway Interface System for interconnecting
    up to seven CAMAC crates (or other devices) and a system controller. The Parallel
    Highway, so called because the data bits are transmitted along the Highway in
    parallel, is capable of handling higher data rates than nonparallel highways.
    However, in some applications, for example, where there are long distances between
    crates or where simplicity of interconnections is particularly important, the
    Serial Highway of IEEE Std 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface System (CAMAC),
    may be more suitable.This standard defines the signals, timing, and logical organization
    of the connections from crate controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers to the
    Parallel Highway through a standard connector. The internal structures of crate
    controllers and Parallel Highway Drivers, and the physical construction of the
    Parallel Highway System are defined only where they affect compatibility between
    parts of the system.
