abstract:
- content: 'This standard lists technical terms and their definitions that have been
    adopted by, or coined for, the television broadcasting industry. It is mainly
    a combination of two earlier standards: IEEE Std201-1955, Definitions of Color
    Terms, and IEEE Std 204-1961, Definitions of Terms Relating to Television. Both
    were originally prepared by the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) prior to the
    merger of the IRE and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in
    1963.'
