abstract:
- content: Users of personal health devices (PHD) have implicit expectations on convenience,
    connectivity, accessibility of their data, and security. They expect to connect
    PHDs to their mobile devices, view their data in the cloud, and easily share with
    their clinicians or care providers. In some cases, the users themselves are taking
    action to build connections between PHDs, mobile devices, and the cloud to create
    the desired system. While many manufacturers are working on solving PHD connectivity
    with proprietary solutions, there is a lack of a standardized approach to providing
    secure Plug &amp; Play interoperability.
