abstract:
- content: It is the purpose of this code to define uniform acceptable methods of
    making tests to determine that the performance and other characteristics of d-c
    rotating machines for aircraft comply with specification and application requirements.
    This code covers rotating machines which operate from or are connected to a direct-current
    system of an aircraft.
