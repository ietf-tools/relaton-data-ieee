abstract:
- content: Electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered, taking
    into consideration certain safety features, for current and inductively coupled
    voltage transformers of types generally used in the measurement of electricity
    and the control of equipment associated with the generation, transmission, and
    distribution of alternating current. The aim is to provide a basis for performance
    and interchangeability of equipment covered and to assist in the proper selection
    of such equipment. Safety precautions are also addressed. Accuracy classes for
    metering service are provided. The test code covers measurement and calculation
    of ratio and phase angle, demagnetization, impedance and excitation measurements,
    polarity determination, resistance measurements, short-time characteristics, temperature
    rise tests, dielectric tests, and measurement of open-circuit voltage of current
    transformers.
