abstract:
- content: This standard applies to surge protectors for application on multiconductor
    balanced or unbalanced data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages
    equal to or less than 1000 V rms, or 1200 V dc. These surge protectors are designed
    to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both.This standard describes the methods
    of testing and criteria for determining the end of life of electrical surge protectors
    used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits. The surge protectors
    covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear
    elements, packaged for the purpose of limiting voltage, current, or both. This
    standard is not intended to cover packaged single gas tube, air gap, varistor,
    or avalanche junction surge-protective devices, which are covered by IEEE Std
    C62.31 [B24], IEEE Std C62.32 [B25], IEEE Std C62.33 [B26], and IEEE Std C62.35
    [B27], respectively.
