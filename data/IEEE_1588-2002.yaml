- content: 'Replaced by IEC 61588-2004 (SH95292 or SS95292) Dual-logo document Abstract:
    A protocol to synchronize independent clocks running on separate nodes of a distributed
    measurement and control system to a high degree of accuracy and precision is specified.
    The protocol is independent of the networking technology, and the system topology
    is self-configuring.'
