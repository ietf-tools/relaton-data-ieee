abstract:
- content: Blockchain interoperability is the ability of two or more blockchain systems
    or applications to exchange information and to mutually use the information that
    has been exchanged. The interfaces and protocols play a very important role in
    realizing interoperability. Therefore, the standard of cross-chain interoperability
    interfaces and protocols, especially those for data authentication and communication
    among homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains systems is needed. Such protocols
    coordinate blockchains while supporting multiple cross-chain models and levels
    to meet business demands without the need to customize gateways or exchanges for
    specific use cases. The standard provides an infrastructure of cross chain interoperability,
    as well as interfaces and protocols of data authentication and communication for
    homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchain interoperability. The protocols include
    the distributed identity protocol, metadata protocol, on-chain proof conversion
    protocol, and cross-chain communication protocol.
