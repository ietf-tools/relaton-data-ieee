abstract:
- content: This document provides users of computer hardware, firmware, software,
    or data systems with recommended practices for assessing and demonstrating the
    system elements within their organization that may be at risk of failure due to
    the Year 2000 problem and related date-specific issues. This recommended practice
    provides the framework for detailed planning and execution of all steps and tasks
    involved in testing for Year 2000 compliance. The resulting plan will outline
    the testing approach and identify system elements that are at risk of failure
    when crossing into the Year 2000 or using data that includes dates after 2000-01-01.
