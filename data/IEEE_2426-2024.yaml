abstract:
- content: Introduced in this guide are the definition, formation, and characteristics
    of fast-front and very fast-front overvoltages. The various measuring techniques,
    including technical details that may be adopted for field application, are also
    described. Field measurement results measured using the techniques described in
    this guide are included for reference.
