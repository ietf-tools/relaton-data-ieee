abstract:
- content: An integrated approach to systematic and documented unit testing is defined.
    It uses unit design and unit implementation information, in addition to unit requirements,
    to determine the completeness of the testing. The testing process described composed
    of a hierarchy of phases, activities, and tasks and defines a minimum set of tasks
    for each activity. The standard can be applied to the unit testing of any digital
    computer software or firmware and to the testing of both newly developed and modified
    units. The software engineering concepts and testing assumption on which this
    standard approach is based and guidance and resource information to assist with
    the implementation and usage of the standard unit testing approach are provided
    in appendixes.
