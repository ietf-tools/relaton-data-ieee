abstract:
- content: 'The following topics were dealt with: The supplement contains errata,
    corrections, and clarifications to IEEE Std 896.5-1993. Futurebus+/sup TM/ standards
    provide system developers with a set of tools with which high performance bus-based
    systems may be developed. This architecture provides a wide range of performance
    scalability over both cost and time for multiple generations of single- and multiple-bus
    multiprocessor systems. This document, a companion standard to ISO/IEC 10857:1994
    [ANSI/IEEE Std 896.1, 1994 Edition], builds on the logical layer by adding requirements
    for three military profiles. It is to these profiles that products will claim
    conformance.<<ETX>>'
