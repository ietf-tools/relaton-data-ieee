abstract:
- content: Electronic devices that develop or utilize analog signals are not presently
    covered by standards. Interface connectivity of modern power-system signal transducers
    based on electronics, such as magneto-optic current transducers and electronic
    relays, are provided in this standard. The existing standardized levels from familiar
    magnetic current and voltage transformers are not readily generated by new types
    of electronic signal transducers.
