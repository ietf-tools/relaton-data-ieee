abstract:
- content: A recommended practice for applying the Distributed Simulation Engineering
    and Execution Process (DSEEP) to the development and execution of distributed
    simulation environments that include more than one distributed simulation architecture
    is described. The distributed simulation architectures to which the recommended
    practice applies include Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level
    Architecture (HLA), and Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA). The DSEEP
    Multi-Architecture Overlay (DMAO) identifies and describes multi-architecture
    issues and provides recommended actions for simulation environment developers
    faced with those issues. The DMAO also augments the DSEEP lists of inputs, recommended
    tasks, and outcomes with additional inputs, recommended tasks, and outcomes that
    apply to multi-architecture simulation environments. This document is an overlay
    to the DSEEP, which is a separate recommended practice.
