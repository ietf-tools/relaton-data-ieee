abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEC/IEEE 62142-2005. To develop a standard syntax and semantics
    for Verilog RTL synthesis. This standard shall define the subset of IEEE 1364
    (Verilog HDL) which is suitable for RTL synthesis and shall define the semantics
    of that subset for the synthesis domain. This standard shall be based on the current
    existing standard IEEE 1364. To define syntax and semantics which can be used
    in common by all compliant RTL synthesis tools to achieve uniformity of results
    in a similar manner to which simulation tools currently use the IEEE 1364 standard.
    This will allow users of synthesis tools to produce well-defined designs whose
    functional characteristics are independent of any particular synthesis implementation
    by making their design compliant with this developed standard. Standard syntax
    and semantics for Verilog &#174; HDL-based RTL synthesis are described inthis
    standard.
