abstract:
- content: This standard applies to high-efÞciency TEFC, horizontal and vertical,
    single-speed, squirrel cage polyphase induction motors, up to and including 500
    hp, in NEMA frame sizes 143T and larger, for petroleum, chemical, and other severe
    duty applications (commonly referred to as severe duty motors). Excluded from
    the scope of this standard are motors with sleeve bearings and additional speciÞc
    features required for explosion-proof motors.
