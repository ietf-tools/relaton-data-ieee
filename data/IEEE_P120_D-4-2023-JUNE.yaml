abstract:
- content: This updated version is based on the material submitted for the 2020 reinstatement
    of Working Group 120. The basic approach for the new organization is to provide
    general guidelines intended to assist nonelectrical engineers and technicians
    involved in quality control, acceptance, and prototype testing where electrical
    instrumentation is the main tool for measuring, observing, or recording physical
    quantities. The contributors strived to maintain the relevant and important knowledge
    that was previously carefully collected and update this as appropriate.
