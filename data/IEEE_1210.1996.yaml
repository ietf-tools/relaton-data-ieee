abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1210-2004 Criteria and test methods for determining the compatibility
    of cable-pulling lubricants (compounds) with cable jacket or other exterior cable
    covering are described in this standard. Cable-pulling lubricants are used to
    lower the tension on cable as it is pulled into conduit, duct, or directionally
    bored holes. Compatibility is important because lubricants should not negatively
    interact with the cables they lubricate. Compatibility of lubricants with a variety
    of common cable coverings is considered.
