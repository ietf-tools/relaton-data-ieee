abstract:
- content: The format of linkable, relocatable, and absolute object modules is specified.
    MUFOM, the Microprocessor Universal Format for Object Modules, is designed to
    apply to a variety of target machines. It permits the linking and relocating functions
    to be isolated from the specification of target architecture, so that a user may
    employ a single program for these functions across all CPUs. It applies to binary
    computers of arbitrary word size and architecture. Two levels of compliance are
    specified, minimum and full. The minimum compliance level affords sufficient flexibility
    to link separately compiled modules, to relocate addresses in simple ways, and
    to load the resulting absolute object modules with a minimal loader. The full
    compliance level affords all of the functionality of the minimum level and adds
    to it arbitrary address-expression handling, type checking capability, librarian
    control commands, and other useful functions for full generality.
