abstract:
- content: To meet the evolving requirements of multi-sourced data computing and sharing,
    a standard for privacy-preserving computation integrated platforms is needed.
    Requirements of privacy computation integrated platforms, including the reference
    architecture, the functional requirements, the performance requirements, and the
    security requirements of privacy-preserving computation integrated platforms,
    are provided by this standard.
