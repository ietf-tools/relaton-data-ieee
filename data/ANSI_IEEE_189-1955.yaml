abstract:
- content: This standard describes a modification of existing techniques which allows
    for the measurement of a receiver employing a ferrite core loop antenna with the
    same precision as that obtained in the measurement of air core loop antennas.
    The test loop employed can be identical to the one described in 'Standards on
    Radio Receivers-Methods of Testing Amplitude-Modulation Broadcast Receivers-1948'.<<ETX>>
