abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides guidelines for applying the assumptions
    defined in IEEE 2846:2022 in safety-related models during the development, testing,
    and deployment of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). It specifically covers approaches
    to identify values for the applicable IEEE 2846:2022 assumptions given the scenario
    context; approaches for identifying reasonably foreseeable values for these assumptions
    given the scenario context and for updating these assumptions across the temporal
    evolution of a scenario; and approaches to validate the selection of assumptions
    through an analysis of the output of the safety-related model, considering different
    kinds of performance objectives of interest.
