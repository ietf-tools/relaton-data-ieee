abstract:
- content: A close-talking pressure-type microphone is anacoustic transducer which
    is intended for use in close proximity to the lips of the talker and is either
    hand-held or boom-mounted. Various types of microphonesare currently used for
    close-talking applications. These include carbon, dynamic, magnetic, piezoelectric,
    electrostrictive and condenser types. Each of these microphones has only one side
    of its diaphragm exposed to sound waves, and its electricoutput substantially
    corresponds to the instantaneoussound pressure of the impressed sound wave. Since
    a close-talking microphone is used in the near sound field produced by a person's
    mouth, it is necessary when measuring the performance of such microphones to utilize
    a sound source which approximates the characteristics of the human sound generator.
