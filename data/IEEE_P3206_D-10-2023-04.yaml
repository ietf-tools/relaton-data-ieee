abstract:
- content: Blockchain-based digital assets exist in a specific system in the form
    of digitization. Considering the diversity of blockchain systems and applications,
    as well as the diversity of digital assets in these systems and applications,
    digital assets based on blockchain systems have typical characteristics such as
    intangibility, encryption verification mechanism, use of distributed ledgers,
    decentralization, consensus algorithms, etc. For better classification and management,
    this standard provides a unified classification method for blockchain digital
    assets for reference. This standard proposes the principles and methods for the
    classification of blockchain-based digital assets. This standard follows the principles
    of scientificity, systematicness and scalability, and proposes an attribute-based
    classification method for blockchain digital assets, whose classification attributes
    include technical attributes, economic attributes and legal attributes.
