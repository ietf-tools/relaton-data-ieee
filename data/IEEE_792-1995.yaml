abstract:
- content: A test procedure for the evaluation of the impulse voltage capability of
    insulation systems of form-wound ac rotating electrical machinery is outlined.
    The procedure is primarily directed toward providing a qualification test for
    the turn insulation in regard to its ability to withstand impulses that might
    be impressed on the terminals of a machine and that result from switching surges,
    lightning, or other disturbances. The standard also presents information on the
    ability of the ground insulation to withstand impulses. The procedure provides
    a basis for the accumulation, analysis, and reporting of information concerning
    impulse-voltage withstand strength of ground and turn insulation, both new and
    aged. The use of multifactor aging tests, combining thermal and electrical aging
    in order to address the withstand capability of micaceous insulation, is recommended.
