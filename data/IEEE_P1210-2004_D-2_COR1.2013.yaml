abstract:
- content: Criteria and test methods for determining 1 the compatibility of cable-pulling
    lubricants (compounds) with cable jacket or other exterior cable covering are
    described in this standard. Cable-pulling lubricants are used to lower the friction
    on cable as it is pulled into conduit, duct, or directionally bored holes. Compatibility
    is important because lubricants should not negatively interact with the cables
    they lubricate. Compatibility of lubricants with a variety of common cable coverings
    is considered. This Corrigendum is to replace the equations in section 4.3 and
    5.3 and to correct the legend in table 4 in section 5.3
