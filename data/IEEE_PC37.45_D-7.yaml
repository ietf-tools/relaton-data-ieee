abstract:
- content: 'This standard establishes specifications for high voltage (above 1000
    volts) distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches and associated accessories
    with rated voltages from 1 through 8.3 Kv. All of these devices are intended for
    use on alternating current distribution systems. These specifications apply to
    the following specific types of equipment: a) Distribution class enclosed single-pole
    air switches. b) Supports, mountings, fuse hooks, tongs, all of the type used
    exclusively with distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches. c) Distribution
    class enclosed single-pole air switches used in enclosure packages.'
