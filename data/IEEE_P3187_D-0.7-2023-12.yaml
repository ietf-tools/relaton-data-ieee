abstract:
- content: 'The development and application of federated machine learning are facing
    the critical challenges about how to balance the tradeoff among privacy, security,
    performance, and efficiency, how to realize supervision covering the whole life
    cycle and how to get the explainable results. Then trustworthy federated machine
    learning is proposed to solve the above problem. In this standard, a general view
    on framework for trustworthy federated machine learning is provided in four parts:
    a principle in trustworthy federated machine learning, requirements from the perspective
    of different principles and different federated machine learning participants,
    and methods to realize trustworthy federated machine learning. It also provides
    some guidance on how trustworthy federated machine learning is used in various
    scenarios.'
