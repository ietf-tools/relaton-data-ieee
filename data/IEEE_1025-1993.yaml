abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2012. Good practice that will improve the ability to assemble
    and erect self-supporting and guyed concrete pole structures for overhead transmission
    lines is presented. Construction aspects after foundation installation and up
    to the conductor stringing operation are covered. Some aspects of construction
    related to other materials use in concrete pole structures are covered, but the
    treatment is not complete. The guide is intended to be used as a reference source
    for parties involved in the ownership, design, and construction of transmission
    structures
