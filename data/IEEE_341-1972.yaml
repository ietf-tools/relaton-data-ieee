abstract:
- content: This standard covers capacitance current switching requirements for ac
    high-voltage circuit breakers rated in accordance with methods given in American
    National Standard Rating Structure for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.04-1964,
    and listed in American National Standard Schedules of Preferred Ratings and Related
    Required Capabilities for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.06-1972.2 It is
    anticipated that the manufacturers of circuit breakers will expend efforts to
    meet the requirements of these new standards as soon as possible. However, it
    is recognized that this will require time for completion; users are cautioned
    to confer with the manufacturer as to whether a specific design meets these standards.
    Circuit breakers manufactured before the publication date of this standard may
    not meet its requirements; the manufacturer should be consulted concerning the
    capacitance current switching capabilities of these earlier designs.
