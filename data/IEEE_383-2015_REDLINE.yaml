abstract:
- content: General requirements and methods for qualifying electric cables and splices
    for nuclear facilities are provided. Cable, wire, and splices within or integral
    to other devices (e.g., instruments, panels, motors) should be qualified using
    the requirements in the applicable device standard or IEEE Std 323(TM). However,
    this standard’s requirements may be applied to the cable, wire and splices within
    these devices. For qualification of fiber optic cable, refer to IEEE Std 1682(TM).
