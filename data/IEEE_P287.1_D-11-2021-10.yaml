abstract:
- content: This IEEE P287 series of documents presents the combined efforts of IEEE
    P287 Working Group that reflect the knowledge and experience of leading specialists
    in the development and measurement of precision coaxial connectors for RF, microwave
    and millimeter-wave frequencies. It presents minimum performance requirements
    to standardize both hermaphroditic and pin- and socket-type connectors (IEEE Std.
    P287.1-D11/10/2021, this document). It provides recommended electrical and mechanical
    test procedures for Instrument Grade and Metrology Grade precision connectors
    (IEEE Std. P287.2-D10/09/2021). Recommended reference procedures including connector
    effects, connector care and cleaning, connector repeatability and reproducibility
    test procedures, and a color code for connectors are detailed in the third part
    of the standard (IEEE Std. P287.3-D10/08/2021).. A bibliography provides a list
    of pertinent references for measurement techniques used in determining electrical,
    mechanical, and dimensional parameters for coaxial connectors.
