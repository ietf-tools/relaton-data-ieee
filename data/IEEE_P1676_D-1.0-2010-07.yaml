abstract:
- content: The scope of this guide is to define and characterize control architecture
    for high-power electronics from power semiconductor device levels to the power
    system level. This guide covers theapplication of power electronics in the areas
    of Power Quality/Custom Power, Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS), High
    Voltage DC Transmission (HVDC), Distributed Generation, Energy Storage applications,
    etc. with a power range from hundreds of kW to thousands of MW, but with emphasis
    on the 1 MW to hundreds of MW.
