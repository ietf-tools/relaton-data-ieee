abstract:
- content: This International Standard establishes a common framework for describing
    the life cycle of systems created by humans. It defines a set of processes and
    associated terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy
    of a system?s structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout
    the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle.
    This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties with the
    ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction.
