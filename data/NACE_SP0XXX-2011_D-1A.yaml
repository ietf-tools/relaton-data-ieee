abstract:
- content: This standard provides a procedure that shall be used to (1) identify structures
    that may be at higher risk for below-grade coating degradation; (2) excavate and
    inspect the selected structure; (3) assess the level of risk to the structure
    in terms of corrosion attack and degradation to the existing coating system; (4)
    prioritize structures to be repaired based on those findings as to whether coating
    repair is needed and if so, to what extent; and (5) apply repair coatings to the
    structure, if applicable. This standard is limited to assessment and repair of
    coating applied below grade and in the transition zone portions of carbon steel
    and galvanized steel transmission towers, grillage, and substation structures.
    It does not address assessment and repair of coatings above the transition zone.
    This standard does not address structural damage assessment, structural repairs,
    weathering steel, or structural integrity. This standard does not address concrete
    foundations or above-grade attachment points including anchor rods, attachment
    nuts, and noncoated ground sleeves. This standard does not address continuous
    immersion environments. This standard does not provide guidelines and repair procedures
    for coating systems for every specific situation because of the complexity and
    diverse nature of conditions to which buried structures may be exposed.
