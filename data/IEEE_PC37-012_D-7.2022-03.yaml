abstract:
- content: Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers switching
    capacitive currents is provided. The application guide addresses the general theory
    of capacitive current switching; and the notions of restrike, re-ignition, non-sustained
    disruptive discharge (NSDD). Voltage factors used for single-phase testing as
    substitute for three-phase testing are explained. Application of circuit breakers
    for different network conditions and different capacitive loads (capacitor banks,
    cables, transmission lines, and filter banks) is treated.
