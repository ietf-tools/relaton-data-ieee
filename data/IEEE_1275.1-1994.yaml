abstract:
- content: 'Firmware is the read-only-memory (ROM)-based software that controls a
    computer between the time it is turned on and the time the primary operating system
    takes control of the machine. Firmware''s responsibilities include testing and
    initializing the hardware, determining the hardware configuration, loading (or
    booting) the operating system, and providing interactive debugging facilities
    in case of faulty hardware or software. The core requirements and practices specified
    by IEEE Std 1275-1994 must be supplemented by system-specific requirements to
    form a complete specification for the firmware for a particular system. This standard
    establishes such additional requirements pertaining to the instruction set architecture
    (ISA) defined by IEEE Std 1754- 1994: IEEE Standard for a 32-bit Microprocessor
    Architecture.'
