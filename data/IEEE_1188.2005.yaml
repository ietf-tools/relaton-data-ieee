abstract:
  content: This recommended practice is limited to maintenance, test schedules and
    testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life and performance of valve
    regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries for stationary applications. It also provides
    guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. An amendment IEEE Std
    1888a is available for this standard.
