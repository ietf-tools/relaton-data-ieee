abstract:
- content: A framework for monitoring the effects and evaluating comprehensive benefits
    of demand response programs is proposed in this guide. From perspectives of ex-ante
    and ex-post evaluation, this guide introduces the evaluation processes on demand
    response effects with its comprehensive benefits and implemented calculation methods
    in detail. This guide could be applied in various electricity market structures
    to provide utilities with the references for the planning, design, implementation,
    and post-evaluation of demand response programs.
