abstract:
- content: Two standard methods for field-strength measurement are described. The
    standard-antenna method consists of measuring the received power or open-circuit
    voltage developed in a standard receiving antenna by the field to be measured
    and computing the field strength from the measured voltage and the dimensions
    and form of the standard antenna. The standard-field method consists of comparing
    voltages produced in an antenna by the field to be measured and by a standard
    field, the magnitude of which is computed from the dimensions of the transmitting
    antenna, its current distribution, the distance of separation, and effect of the
    ground. The measurement procedures are outlined, including calibration of commercial
    field strength and extension of the methods to microwave frequencies. Methods
    for measuring power radiated from an antenna under several different conditions
    are briefly presented, and the important considerations for securing useful and
    accurate measurements are described.<<ETX>>
