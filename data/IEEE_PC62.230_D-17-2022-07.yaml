abstract:
- content: The guide encompasses the application 1 of surge-protective devices for
    electric vehicle infrastructure with system voltages of 1000 V (ac) or 1500 V
    (dc) or less. The document provides guidance for North American types of electric
    vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and electric vehicles (EVs) that conform to the
    SAE J1772 Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice. The guide includes applications
    such as power, data acquisition, and communications related circuitry. The guide
    was developed for use by manufacturers, system designers, educators, and end users
    of electric vehicle supply equipment.
