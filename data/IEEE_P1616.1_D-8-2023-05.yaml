abstract:
- content: The goals and metrics of a data storage system for automated driving (DSSAD)
    are defined in this standard. Functions and common technical requirements for
    data storage are identified. Data elements relevant to automated driving system
    (ADS) Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5 are defined. The usage of data among diverse
    end users is also defined. A compendium of data elements used in vehicles of categories
    M1 and N1 regarding their EDR and DSSAD for partial and fully automated vehicles
    is provided in this standard. An on-board diagnostic (OBD) port lockout/near field
    communication (NFC) protocol for protection against data manipulation via the
    vehicle diagnostic port is provided. This standard is made available without prejudice
    to national and regional laws related to data privacy, protection, and personal
    data processing. Users are responsible for compliance with all such laws and regulations.
    This standard may be frequently updated to include relevant data definitions and
    data elements toward the development of automated vehicles. The overall goal is
    to create a data collection standard for automated driving that includes functional
    requirements for automated vehicle gateways and security guidelines for cloud-based
    automotive data recorder requirements.
