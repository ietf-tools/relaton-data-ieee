abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies two alternate PHYs, TASK and RS-GFSK, in addition
    to those of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2011. The amendment also defines those MAC modifications
    needed to support their implementation. The alternate PHYs enable low cost, ultra-low
    power consumption, and extended battery life, in various frequency bands and geographical
    regions under multiple regulatory domains.
