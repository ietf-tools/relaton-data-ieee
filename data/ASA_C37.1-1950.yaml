abstract:
- content: This standard covers all relays directly associated with electric power
    apparatus. However, it relates only to relays of types directly associated with
    power switchgear. It does not cover relays of types designed primarily for industrial
    control, excitation, or governor regulating, telephone, telegraph, traffic signal,
    or similar purpose.
