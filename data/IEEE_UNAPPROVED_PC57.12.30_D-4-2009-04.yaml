abstract:
- content: 'Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of pole mounted
    enclosures for application in coastal environments containing apparatus energized
    in excess of 600 volts, typically located out of reach of the general public,
    including, but not limited to, the following types of equipment enclosures: pole
    mounted distribution transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted regulators,
    pole-mounted metering equipment, pole-mounted reclosers, and pole-mounted switchgear
    are covered.'
