abstract:
- content: 'This document highlights the role of control systems in the evolution
    of the Smart Grid. It includes an overview of research investigations that are
    needed for renewable integration, reliability, self-healing, energy efficiency,
    and resilience to physical and cyber attacks. These investigations are encapsulated
    in several loci of control including: new methodologies for transmission, distribution,
    and renewable energy, and storage; new roles in emerging topics such as electricity
    markets, demand-response, microgrids, and virtual power plants; and new solutions
    for efficiency, heating and cooling, and security. Together, they usher in new
    horizons for control, such as architecting a system of distributed systems, building
    interfaces to social sciences such as economics, sociology, and psychology, and
    providing a blueprint for critical infrastructure systems. While the emerging
    role of control and its implication on grid architectures have been articulated
    in various papers, a comprehensive discourse on the evolution of Smart Grid and
    the opportunities and challenges that it presents for control, ranging from generators
    to consumers, from planning to real-time operation, from current practice to scenarios
    in 2050 in the grid and all of its subsystems, has not been undertaken hitherto
    and is the purpose of this document. For Corporate or Institutional Access, request
