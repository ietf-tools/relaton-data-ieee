abstract:
- content: The Smart Grid is a system of distributed systems whose domains span the
    more traditionaldomains of bulk generation, transmission, distribution, consumers,
    markets, and powerelectronics, with the growing penetration of relatively newer
    domains such as renewables, electricvehicles, and demand-response-compatible loads.
    Smart Grid control enables prescriptions forinterconnections and interactions
    among these traditional and emerging domains at the rightinstants, at the right
    locations, and in the right manner (Figure 1). The combined expertise ofcontrol
    engineers and scientists will ensure that appropriate loops are closed, optimal
    set pointsand supervisory commands are generated, and desired goals of resiliency,
    renewables integration,reliability, security, and empowerment of consumers are
    met [i.e., to realize a Smart Grid vision(Figure 2)].Starting with the planning
    stages of markets, and following the path of the electron all the wayfrom generation
    to the end userand increasingly in reverse as wellseveral problems withachieving
    the desired set criteria and objectives have to be solved in an automated and
    optimizedmanner. The Smart Grid will be a holistically and pervasively closed-loop
    system; control will becentral in the grid landscape (Figure 3). The underlying
    physics, the interconnection topologies,and the dynamic interactions among various
    domains will inform control algorithms andarchitectures (Figure 4). The challenge
    is to identify the most dominant features of these physics,interconnections, and
    interactions (e.g., control-oriented models), as well as to determine the mostefficient,
    effective, and resilient control solutions. For Corporate or Institutional Access,
