abstract:
- content: 'The IEEE Vision for Smart Grid Communications: 2030 and Beyond provides
    a vision of the communications-related aspects of the Smart Grid in the year 2030,
    and lays out the technology roadmap that will lead us to the vision.This document
    starts with some basic knowledge of the power grid and follows up with fundamental
    building blocks for the communication infrastructure that will accompany the Smart
    Grid. Subsequently, network architectures, including overlays, are discussed at
    length. Also discussed, are important issues such as standards, regulations, security,
    and disruptive technologies. The last part of this document discusses emerging
    technologies such as the solid state transformer, wireless beamed power, and quantum
    key distribution. Throughout the document, a careful distinction is made between
    communications capabilities and the specific technologies that are required to
    support those capabilities. For Corporate or Institutional Access, request a custom
