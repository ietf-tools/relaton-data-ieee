abstract:
- content: 'This IEEE Vision for Smart Grid Communications: 2030 and Beyond Roadmap
    is a high-levelsupplement of the full vision document IEEE Vision for Smart Grid
    Communications: 2030 andBeyond. Communication is a major enabling technology for
    the Smart Grid. We believe that the powergrid will tend to utilize advances in
    communications since the data exchange requirements willscale up for the Smart
    Grid. Smart Grid communication will help to improve demand forecasting,enable
    self-healing from power disturbance events, facilitate active participation by
    consumers indemand-response mechanisms, and provide resilience against physical
    and cyber attacks. SmartGrid communication will also help to improve quality of
    power, allow easy integration ofrenewable energy sources into the grid, foster
    innovation to enable new products, services, andmarkets, assist in optimization
    of assets, and improve operating efficiency. For Corporate or Institutional Access,
