abstract:
- content: This standard applies to IE3 IP56, horizontal and vertical, single-speed,
    squirrel cage polyphase induction motors, up to and including 370 kW, for petroleum,
    chemical, and other severe-duty applications (commonly referred to as IE3 severe-duty
    motors). Excluded from the scope of this standard are motors with sleeve bearings
    and additional specific features required for Ex "d" motors.
