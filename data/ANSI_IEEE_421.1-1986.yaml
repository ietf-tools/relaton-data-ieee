abstract:
- content: Elements and commonly used components in excitation control systems and
    for excitation systems as applied to synchronous machines are defined. The primary
    purpose of the standard is to provide a vocabulary for writing excitation systems
    specifications, evaluating excitation system performance, specifying methods for
    excitation system tests, and preparing excitation system standards. It is also
    intended to serve as an educational aid for those becoming acquainted with excitation
    systems.
