abstract:
- content: Data interchange and standard software services for test and diagnostic
    environments are defined by Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to
    All Test Environments (Al-ESTATE). The purpose of AI-ESTATE is to standardize
    interfaces for functional elements of an intelligent diagnostic reasoner and representations
    of diagnostic knowledge and data for use by such diagnostic reasoners. Formal
    information models are defined to form the basis for a format to facilitate exchange
    of persistent diagnostic information between two reasoners and also to provide
    a formal typing system for diagnostic services. The services to control a diagnostic
    reasoned are defined by this standard.
