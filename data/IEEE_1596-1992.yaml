abstract:
- content: The scalable coherent interface (SCI) provides computer-bus-like services
    but, instead of a bus, uses a collection of fast point-to-point unidirectional
    links to provide the far higher throughput needed for high-performance multiprocessor
    systems. SCI supports distributed, shared memory with optional cache coherence
    for tightly coupled systems, and message-passing for loosely coupled systems.
    Initial SCI links are defined at 1 Gbyte/s (16-bit parallel) and 1 Gb/s (serial).
    For applications requiring modular packaging, an interchangeable module is specified
    along with connector and power. The packets and protocols that implement transactions
    are defined and their formal specification is provided in the form of computer
    programs. In addition to the usual read-and-write transactions, SCI supports efficient
    multiprocessor lock transactions. The distributed cache-coherence protocols are
    efficient and can recover from an arbitrary number of transmission failures. SCI
    protocols ensure forward progress despite multiprocessor conflicts (no deadlocks
    or starvation).
