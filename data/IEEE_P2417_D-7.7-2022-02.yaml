abstract:
- content: 'Abstract: Failures of underground cables and accessories can result in
    the release of toxic gases and large amounts of energy. These failures include
    smoking manholes, manhole fires, and manhole explosions. These failure events
    can damage underground infrastructure and pose a risk to the maintenance crews
    and the public. The root causes, prevention, early detection, mitigation, and
    response to failures of accessories and cable inside, and connected to underground
    electrical structures (i.e., manholes, vaults, handholes, etc.) are examined.
    Methods that can help prevent manhole events and methods that can mitigate the
    severity of manhole events are suggested.'
