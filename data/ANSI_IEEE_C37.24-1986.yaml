abstract:
- content: Superseded by C37.24-2003. This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37
    family on Switchgear, Substations and Protective Relays. This standard applies
    to all forms of outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear. It covers operating limitations;
    the effect of ambient temperature, solar radiation, and wind on internal operating
    temperatures; ventilation and condensation control; enclosure color and finish
    considerations; current-carrying capabilities of switchgear, and suggested modifications
    of standard designs.
