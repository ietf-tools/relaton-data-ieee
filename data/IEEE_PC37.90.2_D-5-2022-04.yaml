abstract:
- content: Design tests for relays and relay systems that relate to the immunity of
    this equipment to Radiated Electromagnetic Interference from Transceivers are
    specified. Field strength, test frequencies, modulation, sweep rates, equipment
    setup and connection, test procedures, criteria for acceptance, and documentation
    for test results are described. This standard has been harmonized with IEC standards
    where consensus could be reached
