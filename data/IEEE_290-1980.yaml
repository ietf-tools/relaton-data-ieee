abstract:
- content: Electric couplings are widely used to transmit mechanical torque from one
    rotating member to another. They are distinguished from mechanical couplings in
    that their torque transmitting capability is initiated, and is frequently controlled,
    by the action of an electromagnetic field. This IEEE standard covers the more
    generally applicable performance characteristics and conducting and reporting
    of the tests for determining the performance characteristics of electric couplings.
