abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to provide guidelines under which data
    sheets for new semiconductor memories are to be generated. Adherence to these
    guidelines should produce data sheets that are concise and consistently define
    the operation and characteristics of semiconductor memory devices. It is not intended
    that data sheets already in existence be changed to this format. However, data
    sheets being generated for the first time for new products should adhere to this
    standard.
