abstract:
- content: During the last revision of the IEEE Std 1434 Guide for the Measurement
    of Partial Discharges in AC Electric Machinery in 2014, it was agreed that a separate
    document would be developed as a recommended practice for measuring pulse-type
    partial discharges (PD) on individual stator coils and bars. The new recommended
    practice IEEE P2465 therefore describes pulse-type partial discharge test methods
    for individual form-wound stator coils and bars that are equipped with PD suppression
    coatings and energized with a sinusoidal voltage source. It provides a uniform
    procedure for measurements in terms of apparent charge at frequencies below 1
    MHz and for measurements in millivolts at higher frequencies, up to 300 MHz. This
    document does not provide pass/fail criteria, but it does describe the measurement
    circuit, the simulated slot, external factors affecting the measurements, the
    recommended method for calibration or normalization, appropriate test voltage
    levels, the need for and parameters of conditioning, and it provides guidelines
    for interpretation of test results.
