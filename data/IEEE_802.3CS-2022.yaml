abstract:
- content: Super-PON optical subscriber access networks, which are in the family of
    Ethernet passive optical networks (EPONs), are defined in this amendment to IEEE
    Std 802.3-2022. Super-PON has a reach of up to 50 km and up to 1024 ONUs over
    a point-to-multipoint passive optical distribution network (ODN) through wavelength
    division multiplexing (WDM). A Super-PON ODN contains a passive wavelength router
    that determines the channels used by the ODN. This standard specifies the Super-PON
    Reconciliation Sublayer (RS), Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS), Physical Medium
    Attachment (PMA) sublayer, and Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer at a MAC
    data rate of 10 Gb/s in the downstream direction and of 10 Gb/s or 2.5 Gb/s in
    the upstream direction.
