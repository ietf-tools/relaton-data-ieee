abstract:
- content: This standard defines the IEEE 1076.1 language, a hardware description
    language for the description and the simulation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal
    systems. The language, also informally known as VHDL-AMS, is built on IEEE Std
    1076¿-2002 (VHDL) and extends it with additions and changes to provide capabilities
    of writing and simulating analog and mixed-signal models.
