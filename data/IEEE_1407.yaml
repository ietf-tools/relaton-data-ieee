abstract:
- content: This guide provides information on the equipment, cable specimens, test
    conditions, and measurements to perform accelerated aging tests on medium-voltage
    cables using water-filled tanks, whether the test be a time to failure test or
    a test in which samples are aged for fixed times followed by a diagnostic test
    such as a step ac breakdown test. The guide identifies the critical test parameters
    and describes techniques for their measurement and control. The implementation
    of the techniques will facilitate a comparison of data obtained by different laboratories.
