abstract:
- content: Basic factors and general considerations in selecting the class and means
    of neutral grounding for a particular ac transmission or subtransmission system
    are covered. An apparatus to be used to achieve the desired grounding is suggested,
    and methods for specifying the grounding devices are given. Transformer tertiary
    systems, equipment-neutral grounding, and the effects of series compensation on
    grounding are discussed.
