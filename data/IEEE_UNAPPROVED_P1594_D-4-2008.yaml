abstract:
- content: This standard covers an all-dielectric fiber optic (WRAP) cable designed
    to be helically wrapped around a conductor or other messenger on overhead power
    facilities. This covers the mechanical, electrical, and optical performance, installation
    guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements, environmental considerations,
    packaging and shipping guidelines and accessories.
