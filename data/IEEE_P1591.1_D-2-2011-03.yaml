abstract:
- content: Hardware performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria
    for a transmission line overhead ground wire (a.k.a shield wire, static wire,
    earth wire, skywire) with optical fibers commonly known as optical ground wire
    (OPGW) are covered. Functional requirements, such as electrical, mechanical, optical
    fiber, environmental and test requirements related to design, installation, in-service,
    and maintenance, including routine tests, are covered.
