abstract:
- content: A secure device identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device
    and supports authentication of the devices identity. Locally significant identities
    can be securely associated with an initial manufacturer-provisioned DevID and
    used in provisioning and authentication protocols toallow a network administrator
    to establish the trustworthiness of a device and select appropriate policies for
    transmission and reception of data and control protocols to and from the device.
