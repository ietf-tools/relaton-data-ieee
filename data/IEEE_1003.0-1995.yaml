abstract:
- content: This guide presents an overview of open system concepts and their applications.
    Information is provided to persons evaluating systems based on the existence of,
    and interrelationships among, application software standards, with the objective
    of enabling application portability and system interoperability. A framework is
    presented that identifies key information system interfaces involved in application
    portability and system interoperability and describes the services offered across
    these interfaces. Standards or standards activities associated with the services
    are identified where they exist or are in progress. Gaps are identified where
    POSIX¨ Open System Environment services are not currently being addressed by formal
    standards. Finally, the concept of a profile is discussed with examples from several
    application domains.
