abstract:
- content: This amendment defines an alternative physical layer (PHY) and a modified
    medium accesscontrol (MAC) layer.Two PHY modes have been defined that enable data
    rates up to 100 Gb/s using the 60 GHz band. MIMOand aggregation methods have been
    defined to increase the maximum achievable communication speeds.Stack acknowledgment
    has been defined to improve the medium access control (MAC) efficiency whenused
    in a P2P (point-to-point) topology between two devices.
