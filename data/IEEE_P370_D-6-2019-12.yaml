abstract:
- content: Standard and recommended practices for ensuring the quality of measured
    data for high-frequency electrical interconnect at frequencies up to 50 GHz are
    provided. This might include, but is not limited to recommending design of test
    fixtures, as well as methods and processes for ensuring the accuracy and consistency
    of measured data for signals with frequency content up to 50 GHz. The standard
    and general practice should be applicable for frequencies higher than 50 GHz as
    well. The methods and techniques contained herein have been validated only to
    50 GHz as of this writing. (This standard incorporates open source. See https://opensource.ieee.org/elec-char/ieee-370/)
