- content: This glossary reprinted from Proc. IRE (USA) vol.48, no.9, Sept.1960 contains
    29 definitions with footnotes mostly related to the concepts of branches, graphs,
    loops, nodes and paths. Two alternative algebraic expressions for the graph determinant
    are explained at some length.
