abstract:
- content: An evaluation framework for the intelligent capabilities of artificial
    intelligence (AI) dialogue systems such as chatbots, consulting terminals, or
    operation interfaces is established in this recommended practice. The recommended
    practice classifies the intelligent capabilities of AI dialogue system into three,
    as cognitive intelligence, emotional intelligence, and system completeness. For
    each class, the capabilities are subdivided into five intelligent levels, from
    the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5, with the performance criteria clarified
    at each level by an evaluation checklist.
