abstract:
  content: A standard test method, including evaluation criteria and performance measures,
    test scenarios for communication between intelligent electronic devices (IEDs)
    that implement substation integrated protection, control, and data acquisition
    is defined. Test scenarios are used to describe what data is exchanged between
    IEDs to perform a specified function that may be distributed between IEDs. All
    test scenarios use a standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) and a core reference
    model to build out an implementation.
