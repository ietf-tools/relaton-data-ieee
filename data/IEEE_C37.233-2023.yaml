abstract:
- content: Test approaches and procedures for the components and the overall protection
    and control system functions are presented in this guide. Test of equipment in
    the system protection scheme, associated communications equipment, auxiliary power
    supplies, and the control of power apparatus are addressed. Much of the testing
    emphasizes a bottom-up approach, in which the basic behavior of scheme components
    are verified first, followed by testing of interconnected components in a function-oriented
    assembly.
