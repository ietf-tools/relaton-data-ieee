abstract:
  content: This amendment specifies the capacitance current switching portion of the
    rating structure for all ac circuit breakers rated above 1000 V, including both
    outdoor and indoor types having preferred ratings listed in ANSI C37.06-2000.
    The rating structure establishes the basis for all assigned capacitance current
    ratings including overhead line switching, cable switching, capacitor bank switching,
    and back-to-back capacitor bank switching.
