abstract:
- content: Collection of data for use in reliability, availability, and maintainability
    assessments of industrial and commercial power systems is described in this recommended
    practice. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer
    with limited experience in the area of reliability. It can also be an aid to all
    engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power
    systems.
