abstract:
- content: Consistent with ISO vocabulary standards, each technical committee is responsible
    for standard terminology in its area of specialization. This International Standard
    provides a common vocabulary applicable to all systems and software engineering
    work falling within the scope of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, Systems and software engineering,
    and the IEEE Computer Society Systems and Software Engineering Standards Committee
    (IEEE-CS S2ESC).The scope of each concept defined has been chosen to provide a
    definition that is suitable for general application. In those circumstances where
    a restricted application is concerned, a more specific definition might be needed.Terms
    have been excluded if they were considered to be parochial to one group or organization;
    company proprietary or trademarked; multi-word terms whose meaning could be inferred
    from the definitions of the component words; terms whose meaning in the information
    technology (IT) field could be directly inferred from their common English dictionary
    meaning.
