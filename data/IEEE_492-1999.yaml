abstract:
- content: General recommendations for the operation, loading, and maintenance of
    synchronoushydro-generators and generator/motors are covered. This guide does
    not apply to synchronousmachines having cylindrical rotors. In this guide, the
    term hydro-generator is used to describe asynchronous machine coupled to a hydraulic
    turbine or pump-turbine. This guide is not intended toapply in any way to the
    prime mover.
