abstract:
- content: The selection and application of controllers and automation to industrial
    and commercial power systems is covered by this recommended practice. It is likely
    to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience
    with this equipment. It can also be an aid to all engineers responsible for the
    electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
