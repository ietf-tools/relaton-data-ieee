abstract:
- content: A method of calculating the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead
    lines, given the weather conditions, is presented. Along with a mathematical method,
    sources of the values to be used in the calculation are indicated. This standard
    does not undertake to list actual temperature-ampacity relationships for a large
    number of conductors nor does it recommend appropriately conservative weather
    conditions for the rating of overhead power lines. It does, however, provide a
    standard method for doing such calculations for both constant and variable conductor
    current and weather conditions.
