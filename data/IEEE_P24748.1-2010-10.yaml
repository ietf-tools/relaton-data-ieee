abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 24748-1:2010 provides information on life cycle concepts and
    descriptions of the purposes and outcomes of representative life cycle stages.
    It also illustrates the use of a life cycle model for systems in the context of
    ISO/IEC 15288 and provides a corresponding illustration of the use of a life cycle
    model for software in the context of ISO/IEC 12207. ISO/IEC TR 24748-1:2010 additionally
    provides detailed discussion and advice on adapting a life cycle model for use
    in a specific project and organizational environment. It further provides guidance
    on life cycle model use by domains, disciplines and specialties. ISO/IEC TR 24748-1:2010
    gives a detailed comparison between prior and current versions of ISO/IEC 12207
    and ISO/IEC 15288, as well as advice on transitioning from prior to current versions
    and on using their application guides. The discussion and advice are intended
    to provide a reference model for life cycle models, facilitate use of the updated
    ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207, and provide a framework for the development of
    updated application guides for those International Standards. ISO/IEC TR 24748-1:2010
    is a result of the alignment stage of the harmonization of ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC
    15288.
