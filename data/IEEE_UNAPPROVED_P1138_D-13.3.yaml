abstract:
- content: is standard covers the performance, test requirements, procedures and acceptance
    criteria for a transmission line overhead ground wire (a.k.a. shield wire,static
    wire,earth wire,skywire) with optical fibers commonly known as Optical Ground
    Wire (OPGW). An OPGW cable has the dual performance functions of a ground wire
    with telecommunicatons capabilities. This standard includes functional requirements
    such as electrical,mechanical,optical fiber,environmental and packaging; test
    requirements related to design, installation,in-service, maintenance, including
    routine tests. This standard is not intended to supersede any established safety
    rules,codes,regulations or practices associated with the use of OPGW cables.It
    is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety
    and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations
    prior to use.
