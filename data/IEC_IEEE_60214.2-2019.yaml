abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 60214 is intended to assist in the selection of tap-changers
    designed in accordance with IEC 60214-1 or IEEE Std C57.131 for use in conjunction
    with the tapped windings of transformers or reactors. Requirements, references
    and definitions relevant to either IEC 60214-1 or IEEE Std C57.131 are given and
    their use is described in Clause 4. It is also intended to assist in understanding
    the various types of tap-changers and their associated equipment available. These
    application guidelines cover on-load tap-changers (resistor and reactor types)
    and de-energized tap-changers.
