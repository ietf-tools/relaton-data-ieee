abstract:
- content: IEEE C95.1-1991 gives recommendations to prevent harmful effects in human
    beings exposed to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 3 kHz to
    300 GHz. The recommendations are intended to apply to exposures in controlled,
    as well as uncontrolled, environments. They are not intended to apply to the purposeful
    exposure of patients under the direction of practitioners of the healing arts.
    The induced and contact current limits of IEEE C95.1-1991 are modified in this
    edition. In addition, field strengths below which induced and contact currents
    do not have to be measured are specified, spatial averaging and measurement distance
    requirements are clarified, and more precise definitions for averaging volume
    and radiated power are provided.
