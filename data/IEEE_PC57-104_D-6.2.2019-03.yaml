abstract:
- content: 'Detailed procedures for interpreting Dissolved Gas Analysis results are
    described in this guide. The document details: 1) Overview of gas generation in
    transformer and DGA process; 2) The purpose and application of DGA; 3) DGA quality
    verification and DGA limitations; 4) DGA interpretation and norms; 5) Fault type
    definitions and identification; 6) Case studies and interpretation example. The
    intent is to provide the operator with useful information concerning the serviceability
    of the equipment. An extensive bibliography on gas evolution, detection, and interpretation
    is included.'
