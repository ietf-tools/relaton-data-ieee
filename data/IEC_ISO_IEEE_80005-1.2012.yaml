abstract:
- content: This paper is the international standard IEC/ISO/IEEE 80005-1. The intention
    of this standard is to define requirements that support, with the application
    of suitable operating practices, efficiency and safety of connections by compliant
    ships to compliant high-voltage shore power supplies through a compatible shore
    to ship connection.

- content: 'IEC/ISO/IEEE 80005-1-2012 describes high voltage shore connection (HVSC)
    systems, on board the ship and on shore, to supply the ship with electrical power
    from shore. This standard is applicable to the design, installation and testing
    of HVSC systems and addresses: HV shore distribution systems; shore-to-ship connection
    and interface equipment; transformers/reactors; semiconductor/rotating converters;
    ship distribution systems; and control, monitoring, interlocking and power management
    systems. It does not apply to the electrical power supply during docking periods,
    e.g. dry docking and other out of service maintenance and repair.'
