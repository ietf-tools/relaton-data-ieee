abstract:
- content: 'This guide provides general recommendations for performing maintenance
    work on energized power-lines. It is not intended to include all of the proven,
    practical methods and procedures; however, these selected comprehensive recommendations
    are based on sound engineering principles, engineering safety considerations,
    and decades of field experiences by many utilities. Included are technical explanations
    as required to cover: certain laboratory testing of tools and equipment; field
    maintenance and care of tools and equipment; work methods for the maintenance
    of energized lines and for persons workings in the vicinity of energized lines.<<ETX>>'
