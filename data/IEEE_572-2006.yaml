abstract:
- content: The basic requirements for qualifying Class 1E Connection Assemblies and
    interfaces that are to be used in nuclear power generating stations are described
    in this standard. The principles, methods, and procedures described are intended
    to be used for qualifying Connection Assemblies, maintaining and extending qualification,
    and updating qualification, as required, if the Connection Assembly is modified.
    The qualification requirements in this standard, when met, demonstrate and document
    the ability of the Connection Assembly to perform safety function(s) under applicable
    service conditions including design basis events, reducing the risk of commoncause
    Connection Assembly failure.
