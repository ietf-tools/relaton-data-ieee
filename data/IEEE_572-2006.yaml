abstract:
- content: This standard provides basic requirements, direction, and methods for qualifying
    class IE connection assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations.
    These include connectors, terminations, and environmental seals in combination
    with related cables or wires as assemblies. Qualification of cable with connectors
    to this standard does not replace qualification to IEEE Std 383<sup>TM</sup>-2003.
    This standard does not apply to containment electric penetrations, fire stops,
    in-line splices, or components for service within the reactor vessel. The qualification
    requirements in this standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability
    of the equipment to perform safety function(s) under applicable service conditions
    (including design basis events) reducing the risks of common cause-equipment failures.
    This standard does not provide environmental stress levels and performance requirements.
