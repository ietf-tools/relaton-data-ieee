abstract:
- content: Design considerations and procedures for storage, location, mounting, ventilation,
    assembly, and maintenance of lead-acid storage batteries for terrestrial photovoltaic
    (PV) power systems are provided. Safety precautions and instrumentation considerations
    are included. This standard applies to all terrestrial photovoltaic power systems,
    regardless of size or application, that contain storage subsystems. The installations
    addressed apply to the operation of an ac, ac/dc, or dc system with the battery,
    PV generating subsystem, and load all connected in parallel.
