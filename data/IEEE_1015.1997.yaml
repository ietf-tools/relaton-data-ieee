abstract:
- content: Information is provided for selecting the proper circuit breaker for a
    particular application. This recommended practice helps the application engineer
    specify the type of circuit breaker, ratings, trip functions, accessories, acceptance
    tests, and maintenance requirements. It also discusses circuit breakers for special
    applications, e.g., instantaneous only and switches. In addition, it provides
    information for applying circuit breakers at different locations in the power
    system, and for protecting specific components. Guidelines are also given for
    coordinating combinations of line-side and load-side devices.
