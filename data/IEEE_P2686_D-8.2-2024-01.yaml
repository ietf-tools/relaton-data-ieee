abstract:
- content: This document includes information and recommendations on the design, configuration,
    and interoperability of battery management systems in stationary applications.
    It considers the battery management system to be a functionally distinct component
    of a battery energy storage system that includes active functions necessary to
    protect the battery from modes of operation that could impact its safety or longevity.
    It provides recommendations on how to configure a battery management system to
    protect a given battery type in each application environment. Lastly, it stipulates
    recommended communication structures and data models that help support interoperability
    and cybersecurity. The result is a comprehensive list of best practices around
    the design and integration of battery management systems that protect the safety
    and longevity of batteries in energy storage applications.
