abstract:
- content: Superseded by 393-1991. This publication specifies applicable tests to
    describe the significant properties of magnetic cores used in electronic applications.
    This publication is primarily concerned with magnetic cores of the type used in
    electronics transformers, magnetic amplifiers, inductors, and related devices.
    However, many of the test specified herein are general in scope and adaptable
    to magnetic cores used in many other applications. Standards covered by this publication
    include test for specifying or measuring, or both, permeability, core loss, apparant
    core loss, induction, hysteresis, thermal characteristics, and other properties
    of all commonly used types of magnetic cores.
