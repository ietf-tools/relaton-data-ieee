abstract:
- content: 'This local area network (LAN) standard deals with all elements of the
    token-passing bus access method and its associated physical signaling and media
    technologies. To facilitate interconnection of stations by way of a LAN using
    the token-passing bus access method, this standard specifies the characteristics
    of the transmission medium; the signaling method used; the frame formats transmitted;
    the actions of a station upon receipt of a frame; the services provided at the
    conceptual interface between the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer and the
    Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer; and the actions, entities and values used
    by management. There are four medium characteristics and signaling methods: 5
    and 10 Mb/s phase-coherent FSK; 1, 5, and 10 Mb/s broadband; 10 and 20 Mb/s fiberoptic;
    and 1 Mb/s phase-continuous FSK.'
