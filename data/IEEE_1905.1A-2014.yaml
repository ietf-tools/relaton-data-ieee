abstract:
- content: 'An abstraction layer for multiple home networking technologies that provides
    a common interface to widely deployed home networking technologies is defined
    in this standard: IEEE 1901&#x2122; over power lines, IEEE 802.11&#x2122; for
    wireless, Ethernet over twisted pair cable, and MoCA 1.1 over coax. Additional
    network technologies are supported by an extensible mechanism using an IEEE OUI
    and an XML-formatted document. Connectivity selection for transmission of packets
    arriving from any interface or application is supported by the 1905 abstraction
    layer. Modification to the underlying home networking technologies is not required
    by the 1905 abstraction layer, and hence it does not change the behavior or implementation
    of existing home networking technologies. The 1905 abstraction layer is between
    layers 2 and 3 and abstracts the individual details of each interface, aggregates
    available bandwidth, and facilitates seamless integration. The 1905 abstraction
    layer also facilitates end-to-end quality of service (QoS) while simplifying the
    introduction of new devices to the network, establishing secure connections, extending
    network coverage, and facilitating advanced network management features including
    discovery, path selection, autoconfiguration, and QoS negotiation.'
