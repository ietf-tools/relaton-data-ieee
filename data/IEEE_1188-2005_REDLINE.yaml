abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is limited to maintenance, test schedules, and
    testing procedures that can be used to optimize the life and performance of valve-regulated
    lead-acid (VRLA) batteries for stationary applications. It also provides guidance
    to determine when batteries should be replaced.
