abstract:
- content: A set of codes and formats to be used by devices connected via the IEEE
    488.1 bus is specified. This standard also defines communication protocols that
    are necessary to effect application-independent and device-dependent message exchanges,
    and further defines common commands and characteristics useful in instrument system
    applications. It is intended to apply to small-scale to medium-scale instrument
    systems comprised mainly of measurement, stimulus, and interconnect devices with
    an instrumentation controller. The standard may also apply to certain devices
    outside the scope of the instrument system environment. IEEE 488.1 subsets, standard
    message-handling protocols including error handling, unambiguous program and response-message
    syntactic structures, common commands useful in a wide range of instrument system
    applications, standard status reporting structures, and system configuration and
    synchronization protocols are covered. IEEE Std 488.2-1992 , 488.2 ,
