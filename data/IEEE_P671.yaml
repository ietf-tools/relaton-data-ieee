abstract:
- content: Specification and test requirements for a non-gyroscopic inertial angular
    sensor which may measure angular jerk, acceleration, rate or displacement with
    or without response down to zero frequency. A standard specification format is
    provided. A compilation of recommended test procedures, derived from those presently
    used in the industry, is also provided. Informative annexes cover design features
    and theoretical principles of operation.
