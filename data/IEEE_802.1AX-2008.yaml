abstract:
- content: Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to
    form a link aggregation group, such that a media access control (MAC) client can
    treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. To this end, it
    specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links,
    consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating
    at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent link aggregation
    capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support
    link aggregation.
