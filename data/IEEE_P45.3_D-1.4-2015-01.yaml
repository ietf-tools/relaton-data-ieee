abstract:
- content: IEEE 45 has grown due to new technology and methods. As a result, the document
    has been divided into a base document (IEEE 45) and eight sub-documents IEEE 45.1
    through IEEE 45.8. This document addresses the recommended practice for systems
    engineering and integration of shipboard electric systems installations.
