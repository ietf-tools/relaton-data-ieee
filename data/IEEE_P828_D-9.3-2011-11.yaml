abstract:
- content: 'Abstract: This standard 1 establishes the minimum requirements for processes
    for Configuration Management (CM) in Systems and software engineering. The application
    of this standard applies to any form, class, or type of software or system. This
    revision of the standard expands the previous version to explain CM, including
    identifying and acquiring configuration items, controlling changes, reporting
    the status of configuration items, as well as software builds and release engineering.
    Its predecessor defined only the contents of a software configuration management
    plan. This standard addresses what CM activities are to be done, when they are
    to happen in the lifecycle, and what planning and resources are required. It also
    describes the content areas for a CM Plan. The standard supports ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2008 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2008 and adheres to the terminology in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    Std 24765 and the information item requirements of IEEE Std15939, Software and
    system engineering --Measurement process'
