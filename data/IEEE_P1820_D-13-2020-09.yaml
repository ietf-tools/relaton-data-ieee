- content: Procedures for selecting external insulation that is likely to be subjected
    to an outdoor environment that includes combinations of contamination, ice, snow,
    or cold fog are specified by this guide. The selection methods are applicable
    to insulators, surge arresters, bushings, live line tools and other high voltage
    ac and dc apparatus with a rated voltage above 1 kV.
