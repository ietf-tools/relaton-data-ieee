abstract:
- content: This is a standard test procedure for the thermal evaluation and qualification
    of electrical insulation systems for Random-Wound AC Electric Machinery, where
    thermal degradation is the dominating aging factor. This procedure compares the
    relative thermal performance of a candidate Electrical Insulation System (EIS)
    to that of a reference Electrical Insulation System. This standard covers insulation
    systems for such machinery with input voltage of up to 600 Volts at 50/60 Hertz.
    This standard provides a statistical method for establishing a relative life-temperature
    relationship for an insulation system. To have any significance, the reference
    insulation system must be supported with adequate field service data. This procedure
    is intended to evaluate insulation systems for use in air cooled, random-wound
    AC electric machinery with usual service conditions. This procedure, on its own,
    does not cover insulation systems such as exposure to conducting contaminates,
    radiation, inverter applications, or operation in oils, refrigerants, or other
    media that potentially degrade insulating materials.
