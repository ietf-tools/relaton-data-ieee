abstract:
- content: Electronic devices that develop or utilize analog signals are not presently
    covered by standards. This Standard provides interface connectivity of modern
    power-system signal transducers based on electronics, such as magneto-optic current
    transducers, and electronic relays. The existing standardized levels from familiar
    magnetic current and voltage transformers are not readily generated by new types
    of electronic signal transducers
