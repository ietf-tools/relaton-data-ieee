abstract:
- content: Two audio program level measuring devices, the peak-program meter and the
    standard volume indicator, are described. The peak-program meter is intended to
    indicate the peak level of audio signals that the transmission or recording medium
    must accommodate if audible distortion is to be avoided. The standard volume indicator
    is intended to provide a means to assign numerical values to the average magnitude
    of audio program signals. The dynamic response requirements specified in this
    standard for the peak-program meter are identical to the normal mode European
    Broadcasting Union standard peak-program meter. This standard does, however, allow
    more flexibility for the selection of the scale.<<ETX>>
