abstract:
- content: Identification of the key parameters that can be monitored for obtaining
    an indication of the condition of liquid-immersed transformers is covered by this
    guide. It also covers risk/benefit analysis, sensor application, and monitoring
    systems application. This guide does not cover interpretation of monitoring results.
