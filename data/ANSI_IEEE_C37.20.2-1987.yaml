abstract:
- content: This standard includes only the requirements for metal- clad and station-type
    cubicle switchgear. These requirements were previously a part of ANSI/IEEE C37.20-1969
    (R 1981), IEEE Standard for Switchgear Assemblies including Metal-Enclosed Bus
    (1974 Consolidated Edition). Other types of equipment previously included in ANSI
    / IEEE C37.20-1969 (R 1981) will now be incorporated in separate publications.
