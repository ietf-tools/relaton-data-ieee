abstract:
- content: Minimum requirements for, and guidance regarding, the methods and procedures
    for qualification of power-driven valve actuators with safety-related functions
    are established. The qualification of all types of power-driven valve actuators,
    including damper actuators, is covered. The standard qualification cases and their
    environmental parameters for the usual locations of safety-related equipment in
    a nuclear generating station are described. Test procedures are presented.
