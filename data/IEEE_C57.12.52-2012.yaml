abstract:
- content: Characteristics relating to performance, limited electrical and mechanical
    interchangeability, and guidance to assist in the proper selection of sealed dry-type
    transformers are provided in this standard. Specific rating combinations are described
    in the range from 750 to 5000 kVA inclusive, with high-voltage 2400 to 34500 Volts
    inclusive and low-voltage 208Y/120 to 4160 Volts inclusive. Sealed dry-type power
    transformers filled with only dry air or nitrogen, at the time of filling, are
    considered. Other gases are not considered in this standard. This standard does
    not apply to other types of transformers, such as specialty, ventilated dry-type,
    pad-mounted dry-type, liquid immersed, instrument, regulating, furnace, mine,
    and rectifier transformers.
