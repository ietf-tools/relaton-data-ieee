abstract:
- content: The scope of this standard is to define a nomenclature for communication
    of information from point-of-care medical devices. Primary emphasis is placed
    on acute care medical devices and patient vital signs information. The nomenclature
    also supports concepts in an object oriented information model that is for medical
    device communications. This amendment extends IEEE Std 11073-10101-2019 to include
    additional terms primarily related to infusion pumps, ventilators, dialysis and
    other key medical devices as well as event and alert identifiers for devices and
    systems used in acute care.
