abstract:
- content: 'This standard applies to power-line carrier line-tuning equipment connected
    between the coupling capacitors and power-line carrier transmitter/receiver terminals
    operating in the frequency range of 30 to 500 kHz over power transmission lines
    and cables or to similar line-tuning equipment in a carrier bypass. Power-line
    carrier line-tuning equipment includes assemblies and components: tuning inductor,
    impedance matching transformer, balancing transformer, tuning capacitor, inductance-capacitance
    (LC) tuning unit, hybrid, filter, protective unit, interconnecting cables and
    enclosure. This standard includes the protective devices that facilitate the safe
    operation and maintenance of the line tuning components under normal and usual
    operating conditions. This standard will develop technical definitions, performance
    ratings, testing methods, and manufacturing requirements for the included line-tuning
    equipment.'
