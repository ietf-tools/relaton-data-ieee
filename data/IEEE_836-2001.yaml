abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a guide to the conduct and analysis
    of precision centrifuge tests of linear accelerometers, covering each phase of
    the tests, beginning with the planning. Possible error sources and typical methods
    of data analysis are addressed. The intent is to provide those involved in centrifuge
    testing with a detailed understanding of the various factors affecting the accuracy
    of measurement, both those associated with the centrifuge and those in the data
    collection process. Model equations are discussed, both for the centrifuge and
    for a typical linear accelerometer, each with the complexity needed to accommodate
    the various identified characteristics and error sources in each. An iterative
    matrix equation solution is presented for deriving the various model equation
    coefficients for the accelerometer under test from the centrifuge test data.
