abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies Ethernet Data Encryption Devices (EDEs). An EDE
    is a two port bridge that uses MACsec to provide secure connectivity for attached
    customer bridges, or for attached provider bridges. EDEs may allow the customer
    (or provider) bridges to continue to use a VLAN Identifier (VID) in transmitted
    frames to select (as already specified in 802.1Q) between provider network or
    provider backbone network services.
