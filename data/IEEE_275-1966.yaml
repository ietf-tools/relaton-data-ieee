abstract:
- content: This Test Procedure has been prepared in the hope that it will serve as
    a useful guide for the evaluation of insulation systems for form-wound coils for
    alternating-current stators and to establish a sound basis for their temperature
    classification. Once this is accomplished in orderly and organized fashion, the
    problems of insulation selection for use in electric apparatus should be simplified.
    The purpose is to define procedures, and not to establish any normal values for
    insulation life, nor to provide any standards of performance whatever.
