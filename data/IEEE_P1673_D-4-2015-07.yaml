abstract:
- content: To develop design, evaluation and installation requirements for conduit
    and cable seals used in the field connected power, control and instrumentation
    wiring systems to equipment in the petroleum and chemical industry exposed to
    pressures above atmospheric (1.5 kilopascals , 0.22 psi) and at above or below
    ambient temperatures. This standard does not cover seals provided by manufacturers
    as part of listed equipment.
