abstract:
- content: A suggested outline for information that should be included in a Design
    Criteria for overhead transmission lines is presented. This Guide is not a Design
    Criteria or a Design Manual, it is a listing of the information that is required
    during the design of a transmission line, and provides guidance for line designers
    in the collection and documentation of how the line was designed; including the
    sources of information used in design and the design approach used
