abstract:
- content: This is an adoption of the Moving Picture, Audio and Data Coding by Artificial
    Intelligence (MPAI)--Technical Specification Neural Network Watermarking as an
    IEEE Standard. The Neural Network Watermarking (MPAI-NNW) Technical Specification
    provides standard methods to measure the ability of 1) a watermark inserter to
    inject a payload without deteriorating the neural network (NN) performance, 2)
    a watermark detector to recognize the presence and the watermark decoder to successfully
    retrieve the payload of the inserted watermark, and 3) a watermark inserter to
    inject a payload and the watermark detector/decoder to detect/decode a payload
    from a watermarked model or any of its inferences at a measured computational
    cost.
