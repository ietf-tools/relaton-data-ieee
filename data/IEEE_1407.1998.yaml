abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 1407-2007. Accelerated aging tests on extruded medium-voltage
    cables using water-filled tanks are addressed. Information on the equipment, cable
    samples, test conditions, and measurements to perform the aging tests is provided.
    Techniques on how to analyze the test data are also inlcuded.The implementation
    of this guide will allow a better description of the test data obtained by different
    laboratories.
