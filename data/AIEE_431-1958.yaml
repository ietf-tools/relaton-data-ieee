abstract:
- content: The scope of this standard is to set forth the basic data on magnetic amplifier
    core materials that should be presented by manufacturers of core materials so
    that the magnetic amplifier designer will have available the parameters of the
    material particularly significant to magnetic amplifier design. The tests proposed
    in this standard are not intended as methods of matching and grading magnetic
    amplifier cores.
