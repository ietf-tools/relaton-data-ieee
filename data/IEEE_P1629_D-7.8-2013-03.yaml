abstract:
- content: This standard defines the general characteristics of pantographs that enable
    current collection from an overhead contact system on light rail transit and heavy
    rail transit systems. The standard contains definitions pertinent to pantographs,
    including general definitions, specific pantograph terminology, and pantograph
    components, pantograph dimensions, and operating characteristics. The operating
    requirements that need to be defined by the purchaser of pantographs are stated.
    In addition, standard dimensions for the collector head and contact strip, various
    pantograph mechanical and operational requirements, environmental conditions,
    and maintainability and documentation requirements are specified. The standard
    also includes various testing methodologies and requirements
