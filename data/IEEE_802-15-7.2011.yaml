abstract:
- content: A PHY and a MAC layer for short-range optical wireless communications using
    visible light in optically transparent media are defined. The visible light spectrum
    extends from 380 nm to 780 nm in wavelength. The standard is capable of delivering
    data rates sufficient to support audio and video multimedia services and also
    considers mobility of the visible link, compatibility with visible-light infrastructures,
    impairments due to noise and interference from sources like ambient light and
    a MAC layer that accommodates visible links. The standard adheres to applicable
    eye safety regulations.
