abstract:
- content: This International Standard contains methods for condition monitoring of
    organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using the
    indenter modulus technique in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible
    measurements. It includes the requirements for the selection of samples, the measurement
    system and measurement conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results.
