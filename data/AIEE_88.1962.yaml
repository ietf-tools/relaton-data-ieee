abstract:
- content: New definitions of terms associated with telemetering are proposed only
    when considered necessary and where no known suitable definition exists. No effort
    has been made to include all terms defined in existing formal glossaries, such
    as American Standard Definitions of Electrical Terms, ASA C42. It is realized
    that many terms defined in other publications apply to telemetering as well, and
    it is expected that these documents will assist in the standardization of telemetering
    nomenclature.
