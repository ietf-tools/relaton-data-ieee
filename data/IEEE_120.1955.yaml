abstract:
- content: The methods given here include measurements, as made with either indicating
    or integrating instruments, of power, voltage and current in direct current and
    alternating-current single-phase and polyphase rotating machinery, transformers,
    induction apparatus, arc and resistance heating equipment and mercury rectifiers.
    It also includes measurements made with supplementary instruments and devices.
    This code does not include such measurements as resistance and temperature which
    are often included in determining the performance characteristics of electric
    machinery. Instruments for these latter measurements will be found in the specific
    codes dealing with the particular measurement; such as AIEE Master Test Code for
    Temperature Measurement, No. 551.
