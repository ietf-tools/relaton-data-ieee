abstract:
- content: This standard covers the performance, test requirements, procedures, and
    acceptance criteria for a transmission line overhead ground wire (a.k.a. shield
    wire, static wire, earth wire, skywire) with optical fibers commonly known as
    optical ground wire (OPGW). An OPGW cable has the dual performance functions of
    a ground wire with telecommunications capabilities. This standard includes functional
    requirements such as electrical, mechanical, optical fiber, environmental and
    packaging, and test requirements related to design, installation, in-service,
    maintenance, including routine tests. This standard is not intended to supersede
    any established safety rules, codes, regulations, or practices associated with
    the use of OPGW cables. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard
    to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability
    of regulatory limitations prior to use.
