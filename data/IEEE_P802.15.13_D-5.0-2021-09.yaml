abstract:
- content: The protocol and compatible network equipment for optical wireless communications
    and its operation as an optical wireless personal area network (OWPAN), supporting
    data rates of multiple Gbit/s for wireless specialty applications, are defined
    in this standard. A medium access control (MAC) sublayer, supporting scheduled
    and polled medium access, as well as two physical layers (PHYs), enabling low
    complexity, low power, and high throughput are included.
