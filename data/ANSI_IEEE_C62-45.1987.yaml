abstract:
- content: Guidance is provided for applying surge testing to AC power interfaces
    of equipment connected to low-voltage ac power circuits that are subject to transient
    overvoltages. Signal and data lines are not addressed in this document, nor are
    any specifications stated on the withstand levels that might be assigned to specific
    equipments. An important objective of the document is to call attention to the
    safety aspects of surge testing.
