abstract:
- content: A transformer’s or reactor’s function and life expectancy are directly
    related to the temperatures that its components and structures experience. While
    temperature control schemes and data gathering activities may be employed in an
    effort to keep temperatures within favorable levels, accurate and timely measurement
    of temperature must be achieved before any controls or gathering of data can be
    effective. At the center of a transformer’s thermal performance is winding temperature.
    It is the primary factor that drives thermal activity in every other structure
    and material in the transformer. Thus this topic is well covered in the document.
    Other structures, such as ties, taps and bushings do produce some local heat,
    and are also topics that are discussed. Thermal modifying elements such as insulating
    liquid, fans, pumps are discussed, but only as far they effect temperature measurements.
    The temperature of the ultimate heatsink, typically air, water or some other liquid
    is particularly important, since the effective removal of the heat produced by
    the windings is predicated on efficient transfer of heat energy to a lower energy
    mass. In order to ensure that auxiliaries such as fans and pumps are performing
    their temperature moderating functions properly, measurements of motor temperatures
    or motor current are sometimes employed. All of these topics are discussed along
    with recommended equipment for and methods of making accurate and timely temperature
    measurements.
