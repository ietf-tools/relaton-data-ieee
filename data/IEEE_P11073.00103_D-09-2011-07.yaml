abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this guide describes the landscape of transport-independent applications
    and information profiles for personal telehealth devices. These profiles define
    data exchange, data representation, and terminology for communication between
    personal telehealth devices and compute engines (e.g. health appliances, set top
    boxes, cell phones, personal computers). The guide provides a definition of personal
    telehealth devices as devices used for life activity, wellness monitoring, and/or
    health monitoring in domestic home, communal home, and/or mobile applications.
    Use cases relevant to these scenarios and environments are also presented.
