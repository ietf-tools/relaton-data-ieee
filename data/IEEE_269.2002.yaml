abstract:
  content: Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic
    characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets, and headsets are provided
    in this revised standard. The methods may also be applicable to a wide variety
    of other communications equipment, including cordless, wireless, and mobile communications
    devices. Measurement results may be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized
    basis. Application is in the frequency range 100&#8211;8500 Hz.
