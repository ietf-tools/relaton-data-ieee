abstract:
- content: Electrical ratings and test requirements of cable joints used with extruded
    andlaminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 2.5
    kV to 500 kV areestablished in this standard. In addition, test requirements for
    joint metallic shield and jacketingcomponents are defined. A variety of common
    joint constructions are also defined. This standardhas been designed to provide
    uniform testing procedures that can be used by manufacturers andusers to evaluate
    the ability of underground power cable joints, and associated metallic shieldsand
    jacketing components, to perform reliably in service.
