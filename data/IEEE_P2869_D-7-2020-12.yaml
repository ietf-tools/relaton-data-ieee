abstract:
- content: The synchronous monitoring method, the layout principle, and the analysis
    of monitoring results of direct current (dc) magnetic bias current distribution
    on transmission networks 110 kV and above from transformers (including converter
    transformers) are specified in this guide. This guide does not discuss the effect
    of dc or geomagnetically induced current (GIC) on transformers.
