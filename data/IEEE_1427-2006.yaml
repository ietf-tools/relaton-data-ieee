abstract:
- content: This guide, covering three-phase ac systems from 1 kV to 800 kV, provides
    recommended electrical operating and safety clearances and insulation levels in
    air-insulated electric supply substations; addresses insulation coordination procedures;
    provides design procedures for the selection and coordination of the insulation
    levels within the station as they relate to substation clearances; and addresses
    how reduced clearances in high-voltage ac substations will allow for compact bus
    arrangements and substation voltage uprating applications.
