abstract:
  content: Low-voltage metal-enclosed switchgear-which contains either stationary
    or drawout, manually or electrically operated low-voltage ac or dc power circuit
    breakers in individual grounded metal compartments, in three-pole, two-pole, or
    single-pole construction is covered. Rated maximum voltage levels are 254V, 508V,
    or 635V (ac) and 300/325V, 800V, 1000V, 1200V, 1600V, or 3200V (dc). The preferred
    continuous current ratings of the main bus in ac designs are 1600A, 2000A, 3000A,
    3200A, 4000A, or 5000A. For dc designs, the preferred ratings are 1600A, 2000A,
    2500A, 3000A, 4000A, 5000A, 6000A, 8000A, 10000A, or 12000A. The switchgear may
    also contain associated control, instruments, metering, protective, and regulating
    devices as necessary. The standard deals with service conditions, ratings, temperature
    limitations, and classification of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric)
    withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application.
