abstract:
- content: This standard specifies a wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE)
    dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) application, known as the WAVE resource
    manager (RM), designed to allow applications at remote sites to communicate with
    devices known as onboard units (OBUs), which are mounted in vehicles, through
    devices known as roadside units (RSUs), which are mounted on the roadside. The
    WAVE RM, acting like an application layer, multiplexes the communications of multiple
    remote applications, each communicating with multiple OBUs. The purpose of the
    communication is to conduct information interchange, needed to implement the requirements
    of the remote WAVE DSRC applications.
