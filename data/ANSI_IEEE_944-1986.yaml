abstract:
- content: The application and performance requirements for a low-voltage uninterruptible
    power supply system used for service in power generating stations are defined.
    Application requirements such as load information and service conditions, routine
    testing requirements for inverters with or without rectifiers/chargers, and transfer
    switches are all covered. Only semiconductor AC to AC converter systems with a
    DC electric energy storage capability are considered. Particular attention is
    given to nuclear power generating stations.<<ETX>>
