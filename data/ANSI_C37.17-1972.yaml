abstract:
- content: This standard pertains to direct-acting overcurrent, reverse-current, and
    undervoltage tripdevices of both the electromechanical and ac solid-state types
    integral with low-voltage ac andgeneral-purpose dc power circuit breakers covered
    by American National Standards. The solid-statedirect-acting overcurrent trip
    devices may include ground trip elements. These direct-actingtrip devices are
    sometimes referred to as "opening releases," especially in IEC (InternationalElectrotechnical
    Commission) Recommendations or "Specifications".
