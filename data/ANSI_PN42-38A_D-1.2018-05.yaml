abstract:
- content: Amendment 1 addresses an observation made by a user of the standard. The
    observation raised a concern that misunderstandings may occur due to the common
    use of “tn” for other calculations. To address the concern, “tn” was changed to
    “p”. The value for the number of trials used in the standard remains the same.
