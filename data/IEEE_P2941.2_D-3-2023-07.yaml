abstract:
- content: A set of application program interfaces (APIs) is defined in this standard,
    which is aimed at breaking down the barriers between different deep learning inference
    engines and applications. The APIs are comprised of functional interfaces including
    parameter reading, model compilation optimization, operator registration, thread
    management, input/output data acquisition, inference instance creation and inference
    execution.
