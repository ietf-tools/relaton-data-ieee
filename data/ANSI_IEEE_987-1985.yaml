abstract:
- content: The standard acts as a guide for the application of composite insulators
    to overhead transmission and distribution lines. It is based on utility field
    experiences, results of research laboratory tests, and manufacturers' recommendations.
    It deals with composite insulators, which include a core, weathersheds, and metal
    end fittings. The core consists of resin and glass fibers. The weathersheds are
    of polymeric materials such as epoxy resins or elastomers and normally contain
    inorganic fillers.<<ETX>>
