abstract:
- content: Withdrawn Standard June 1984. These criteria established minimum requirements
    for the safety-related functional performance and reliability of protection systems
    for stationary land-based nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power
    generation. Fulfillment of these requirements does not necessarily fully establish
    the adequacy of protective system functional performance and reliability. On the
    other hand, omission of any of these requirements will, in most instances, be
    an indication of system inadequacy. For purposes of these criteria, the nuclear
    power generating station protection system encompasses all electric and mechanical
    devices and circuitry (from sensors to actuation device input terminals) involved
    in generating those signals associated with the protective function. These signals
    include those that actuate reactor trip and that, in the event of a serious reactor
    accident, actuate engineered safeguards such as containment isolation, core spray,
    safety injection, pressure reduction, and air cleaning.
