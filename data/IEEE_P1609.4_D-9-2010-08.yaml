abstract:
- content: This standard describes multi-channel wireless radio operations, WAVE mode,
    medium access control (MAC) and physical layers (PHYs), including the operation
    of control channel (CCH) and service channel (SCH) interval timers, parameters
    for priority access, channel switching and routing, management services, and primitives
    designed for multi-channel operations.
