abstract:
  content: Minimum requirements for the design, construction, manufacturing, testing,
    purchasing, and application of electric submersible pump (ESP) cable are presented.
    The cable is round or flat, with ethylenepropylene rubber insulation, nitrile
    jacket, ethylenepropylene diene monomer (EPDM) jacket or lead sheath, and armor.
    These cables are for voltages not exceeding 3 kV or 5 kV (phase to phase) and
    conductor temperatures not exceeding 140 C (284 F) for nitrile or a maximum of
    232 C (450 F) for EPDM jacket or lead sheath cable. Conductors, insulation, barrier
    (optional), assembly with or without jacket, armor, requirements for testing by
    the manufacturer, and cable ampacity are all covered in the document.
