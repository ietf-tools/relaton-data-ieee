abstract:
- content: This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about public safety
    and emergency management issues involved in transportation-related events, through
    common incident management message sets. The message sets specified are consistent
    with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and are described
    using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1 or ASN) syntax. This standard comprises
    the basic volume of the family of incident management standards, a multi-volume
    set of documents centered around this Base Standard. Other members of that family
    include three other companion volumes, specifying incident management message
    sets for transportation-management-related data exchange and hazardous-material-
    and cargo-related data exchange, etc. Collectively, that family of standards shall
    be referred to as the 1512 Family of Standards. The goal of that family of standards
    is to support efficient communication for the real-time, interagency management
    of transportation-related events. Those events include incidents, emergencies,
    accidents, planned roadway closures, special events, and disasters caused by humans
    or natural events. Those events include any such event that impacts transportation
    systems or that causes a report to be received by an emergency management system,
    whether or not the event actually affects a transportation system and whether
    or not a response is required.
