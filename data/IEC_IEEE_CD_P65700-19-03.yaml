abstract:
- content: 'This International Standard applies to outdoor and indoor bushings of
    any voltage used on d.c. systems, of capacitance graded or gas insulated types
    for use as components of oil-filled converter transformers and smoothing reactors,
    as well as air to air d.c. bushings. This standard does not apply to the following:
    - cable terminations (potheads); - bushings for instrument transformers; - bushings
    for test power supplies; - bushings applied with gaseous insulation(other than
    air at atmospheric pressure) external to the bushing; - bushings for industrial
    application; - bushings for traction application; - bushings for distribution
    class transformers; This standard makes reference to IEC 60137 for general terms
    and conditions and defines the special terms used, operating conditions, ratings,
    test procedures as well as general mechanical and electrical requirements for
    bushings for d.c application.'
