abstract:
- content: Load modeling plays a very important role in power system modeling, and
    the load model is an indispensable component in power system simulation. To get
    accurate load models and formulate a unified document, this standard is developed
    to provide comprehensive policies and procedures of load modeling and simulations.
    A review and comparison of two existing most widely used methodologies for load
    modeling is presented in this document, that is, the measurement-based and component-based
    approach. A critical and updated overview of opportunities and challenges of load
    modelling with emerging networks and components is also provided. The guidelines
    for power system simulation with a variety of load models are proposed. A case
    study adhering to the proposed guidelines clearly indicates the need for a hybrid
    approach in the future that will combine strengths of measurement-based and component-based
    approaches with data acquisition capabilities offered by modern measurement equipment.
