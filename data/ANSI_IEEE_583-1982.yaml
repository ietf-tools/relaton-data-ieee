abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to serve as a basis for a range of modular instrumentation
    capable of interfacing transducers and other devices to digital controllers for
    data and control. It consists of mechanical standards and signal standards that
    are sufficient to ensure physical and operational compatibility between units
    regardless of source. The standard fully specifies a data bus (Dataway) by means
    of which instruments and other functional modules can communicate with each other,
    with peripherals, with computers, and with other external controllers.
