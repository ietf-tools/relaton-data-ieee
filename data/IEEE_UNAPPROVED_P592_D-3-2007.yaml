abstract:
- content: IEEE Standard 592-1990, IEEE Standard for Exposed Semiconducting Shields
    on High-Voltage Cable Joints and Separable Insulated Connectors, provides design
    tests for shield resistance and a simulated fault-current initiation for exposed
    semiconducting shields used on cable accessories, specifically joints and separable
    insulated connectors rated 15 kV through 35 kV.
