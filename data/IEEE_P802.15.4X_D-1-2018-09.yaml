abstract:
- content: Enhancements to the IEEE 802.15.4(TM) smart utility network (SUN) orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) physical layers (PHYs) that enable support
    for data rates up to 2.4 Mb/s are defined by this amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.4(TM)-2015.
    This amendment also defines additional channel plans, as needed, to support emerging
    applications.
