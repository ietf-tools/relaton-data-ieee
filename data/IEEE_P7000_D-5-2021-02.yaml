abstract:
- content: The standard establishes a set of processes by which organizations can
    include consideration of human ethical values throughout the stages of concept
    exploration and development. This standard supports management and engineering
    in transparent communication with selected stakeholders for values elicitation
    and prioritization. It involves traceability of ethical values through an operational
    concept, value propositions, and value dispositions in the system design. The
    standard describes processes that provide for traceability of ethical values in
    the concept of operations, ethical requirements, and ethical risk-based design.
    It is applicable for all sizes and types of organizations using their own life
    cycle models.
