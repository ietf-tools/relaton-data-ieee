abstract:
- content: Standard terminal markings and connections are described for single-phase
    andthree-phase distribution, power, and regulating transformers. For terminal
    markings, it coverssequence designation, external terminal designation, neutral
    terminal designation, grounded terminal designation, and marking of full and tap
    winding terminals. Additive and subtractive polarity and parallel transformer
    operation are described. Connections of single-phase transformers in various configurations
    and angular displacement of three-phase transformers to connect to various system
    phase displacements are covered.
