abstract:
- content: This recommended practice contains information concerning system voltage
    nomenclature and the preferred voltage ratings of distribution apparatus and utilization
    equipment. This is essential to proper voltage identification throughout a power
    distribution system. The recommended practice also discusses the dynamic characteristics
    of the system and the proper principles of voltage control applied so that satisfactory
    voltages will be supplied to utilization equipment under operating conditions.
    An understanding of system voltage nomenclature and the preferred voltage ratings
    of distribution apparatus and utilization equipment is essential to help ensure
    proper voltage identification throughout a power distribution system. The dynamic
    characteristics of the system need to be recognized and the proper principles
    of voltage control applied so that satisfactory voltages will be supplied to all
    utilization equipment under all normal conditions of operation.
