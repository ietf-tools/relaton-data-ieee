abstract:
- content: 'This recommended practice applies to the application and installation
    procedures of auxiliary devices in or on electric rotating machines that are employed
    in hazardous locations classified as Class I, Division 2 and Zone 2 and Class
    II, Division 2 and Zone 22 under commonly used worldwide regulations. These regulations
    are: the National Electrical Code&#174; (NEC&#174;); the Canadian Electrical Code
    (CE Code); and combined practices of the International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC). Included is a list of source documents, definitions and nomenclature. Devices
    include terminal housings, heaters, surge protection, power factor correction
    capacitors, shaft bonding (shaft grounding), and enclosures. Special marking requirements
    are also discussed.'
