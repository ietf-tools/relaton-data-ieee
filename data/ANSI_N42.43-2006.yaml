abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the operational and performance requirements for
    transportable and/or mobile radiation monitors used in U.S. Homeland Security
    applications. Transportable radiation monitors are designed to be transported
    to a location and used for a specific task or for a specified period of time and
    do not require permanent mounting platforms. Mobile monitors are those systems
    that are typically in operation on a platform that is in motion. This standard
    also addresses radiation detection systems that can be carried on a person such
    as backpack-type systems. The "IEEE Get Program" grants public access to view
    and download individual PDFs of select standards at no charge. Visit https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page
    for details.
