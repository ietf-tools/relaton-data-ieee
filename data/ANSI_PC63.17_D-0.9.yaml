abstract:
- content: Specific test procedures are established for verifying the compliance of
    unlicensed personal communications services (UPCS) devices (including wideband
    voice and data devices) with applicable regulatory requirements regarding radio-frequency
    emission levels and spectrum access procedures. In addition to the measurements
    specified herein, UPCS devices may also be required to be tested in accordance
    with other standards. Examples are listed in Annex A 47CFR15, Subpart D Rules
    and test cases for UPCS devices.
