abstract:
- content: 'This standard provides uniform measurement procedures for determining
    the shielding effectiveness of electromagnetic (EM) shielding for a variety of
    enclosures and boxes having all dimensions between 0.1 m and 2 m in the radio
    frequency range not addressed by IEEE Std 299(TM)-2006. This standard is divided
    into two parts: Part I - 0.75 m to 2 m and Part II - physically small (&lt; 0.75
    m) but electrically large enclosures. In addition to a number of annexes aiding
    the measurement of shielding effectiveness of these enclosures, Annex I addresses
    physically small and electrically small enclosures, and Annex J addresses electrically
    small enclosures in reverberation chambers. Problems occurring in the testing
    of small enclosures having linear dimension less than 2 m are very different from
    determining the shielding effectiveness of large rooms and broad depending on
    the actual size of the enclosure itself. A number of other annexes are included
    that address rationale, mathematical formulas, selection of measurement techniques,
    preliminary measurement and repairs, wall-mounted monopoles, impedance mismatch
    correction, and using isolated monopoles in outer reverberation chambers.'
