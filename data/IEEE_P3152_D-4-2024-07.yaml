abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to define elements to improve transparency
    in the identification of the agency behind media or communications, such as a
    machine intelligence, a human being, or a combination of entities. The goal is
    to facilitate transparency, understanding, and trust during online, telephone,
    robotic, or other electronic interactions, thereby strengthening provisions for
    public safety and security.
