abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of this standard is to document the minimum information that
    users of bolometric power meters may need. It also provides potential purchasers
    and others with a common means for making comparisons between instruments and
    provides a uniformity of information among manufacturers. This standard applies
    to bolometric power meters as complete instruments and to their constituent parts:
    bolometric detectors, bolometer units, and bolometer elements. Bolometer power
    measurement instrumentation is generally used to measure, below 100 mW and above
    10 MHz, the average power of electromagnetic waves propagating in a single mode
    in waveguide or coaxial transmission lines. The power range can be extended by
    the use of attenuators or directional couplers, or both.<<ETX>>'
