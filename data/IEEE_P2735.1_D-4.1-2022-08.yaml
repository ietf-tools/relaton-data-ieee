abstract:
- content: This standard designs and standardizes data input interfaces, computing
    service interfaces, interconnection service interfaces, Laboratory Information
    Management System (LIMS) service interfaces, functional design requirements, and
    constraints for Complex Virtual Instruments (CVI) in the field of household appliance
    testing based on IEEE Std 2735. The purpose is to process the data or metadata
    from different types of household appliance complex virtual instruments.
