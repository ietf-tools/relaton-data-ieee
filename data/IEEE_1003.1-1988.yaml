abstract:
- content: The Technical Committee on operating systems and application environments
    of the IEEE Computer Society carried out a series of analyses of various problems
    encountered by users of IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE standard portable operating
    system interface for computer environments. The results of its deliberations are
    presented. The intent is to give the POSIX community reasonable ways of interpreting
    the unclear portions of the standard.<<ETX>>
