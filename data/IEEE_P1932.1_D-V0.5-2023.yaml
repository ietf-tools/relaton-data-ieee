abstract:
- content: 'The proliferation of connected users and downloaded applications has driven
    the development of a new paradigm in wireless mobile networks. This paradigm utilizes
    additional air interfaces operating in the unlicensed spectrum to serve as supplementary
    downlinks (SDL) and enhance end-user throughput. However, integrating these interfaces
    into licensed base stations can be challenging, as they are distributed across
    various domains. Wi-Fi is a key technology for increasing capacity through the
    user plane interface. Traffic is buffered in Wi-Fi when unlicensed channels become
    unavailable, and transmissions resume once new radio slots are free. To meet the
    strict round-time delay requirements of 5G, this standard defines a new virtual
    controller that resides at the mobile edge-cloud. The controller coordinates the
    multi-connectivity model and traffic sharing between licensed and unlicensed interfaces
    based on the real-time availability of unlicensed channels for a specific user
    equipment. This standard presents two schemes for managing multi-connectivity
    modes: Distributed and Centralized. In the Distributed scheme, the controller
    manages traffic forwarding and steering between distributed radio interfaces across
    domain sites. In the Centralized scheme, various radio interfaces are colocated
    in the same base station, and the controller manages traffic steering through
    a new unified 5G MAC design. The controller ensures traffic sharing between different
    interfaces, given that operators provide access to operator-deployed Wi-Fis or
    any other customer Wi-Fi using separate SLA agreements. Multi-connectivity modes
    imply the provision of efficient new services that may require measuring airtime
    for each interface and changes to user plane topology.'
