abstract:
  content: Revision of IEEE Std C37.011-1994 Procedures and calculations necessary
    to apply the standard transient recovery voltage (TRV) ratings for ac high-voltage
    circuit breakers rated above 1000 V and on a symmetrical current basis are covered.
    The capability limits of these circuit breakers are determined to a great degree
    by the TRV. TRV ratings are compared with typical system TRV duties.
