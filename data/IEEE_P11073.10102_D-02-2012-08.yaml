abstract:
- content: This standard extends the base IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature to provide
    support for ECG annotation terminology. It may be used either in conjunction with
    other IEEE 1073 standards (e.g., IEEE 11073-10201 Domain information model) or
    independently with other standards. Major subject areas addressed by the nomenclature
    include ECG beat annotations, wave component annotations, rhythm annotations,
    and noise annotations. It also defines additional "global" and "per-lead" numeric
    observation identifiers, ECG lead systems and additional ECG lead identifiers.
