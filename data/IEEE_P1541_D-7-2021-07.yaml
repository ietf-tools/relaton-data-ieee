abstract:
- content: Names and letter symbols for prefixes that denote multiplication of a unit
    by the binary multiplier 2 10n, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 are defined.
    Although the prefixes may be used with all units in all fields where multiplication
    by a binary multiplier is found to be appropriate, their primary use is in the
    field of information technology.
