abstract:
- content: This Application Guide provides information on what a Faulted Circuit Indicator
    (FCI) is designed to do and describes methods for selecting FCIs for three-phase,
    200 / 600 amp underground distribution circuits. This application guide will complement
    the existing single phase application guide.
