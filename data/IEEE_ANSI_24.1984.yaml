abstract:
- content: This standard covers electrical, dimensional, and related requirements
    for outdoor power class apparatus bushings which have basic impulse insulation
    levels of 110 kV and higher. It provides specific values for dimensional and related
    requirements which are to be interpreted, measured, or tested in accordance with
    ANSI/IEEE Std 21-1976. Bushings covered by this standard are intended for use
    as components of oil-filled transformers, oil-filled reactors, and oil circuit
    breakers.
