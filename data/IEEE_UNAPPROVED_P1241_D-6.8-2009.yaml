abstract:
- content: The material presented in this standard is intended to provide common terminology
    and test methods for the testing and evaluation of analog-to-digital converters
    (ADCs). This standard considers only those ADCs whose output values have discrete
    values at discrete times, i.e. they are quantized and sampled.
