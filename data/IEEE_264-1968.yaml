abstract:
- content: This publication pertains to wide-band transformers, transmitting power
    of more than 100 watts.* Guides to application and test procedures are included.
    Appendices contain certain precautions and recommended practices. Provision is
    made for including data for use in the design of feedback amplifiers and control
    networks or other circuits in which knowledge of the transformer amplitudeand
    phase-frequency response is needed by the system designer. These transformers
    are required to transform voltage within specified tolerances of amplitude and
    phase when operating between specified impedances.
