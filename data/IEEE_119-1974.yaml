abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for the application
    of temperature-measurement techniques in measuring the operating temperature and
    temperature rise of electrical machines, instruments, and apparatus in common
    use. The guidelines are limited to measurement of temperatures below 500 degrees
    C; however, some measurement techniques described herein are capable of measuring
    temperatures above 500 degrees C, and these may be used at the higher temperatures
    after the validity and safety of the technique for the temperature involved have
    been confirmed. This recommended practice does not define permissible temperature
    rise or corrections since they must form a part of the standard for the particular
    apparatus involved. Should contradiction between guidelines stated herein and
    those in a specific apparatus test procedure or standard exist, the specific apparatus
    publication will govern.<<ETX>>
