abstract:
- content: This standard deals with software for the CAMAC modular instrumentation
    and interface system of ANSI/IEEE Std 583-1975, Modular Instrumentation and Digital
    Interface System (CAMAC)(also Report EUR 4100e of the Commission of the European
    Communities). The report on which this document is based, ERDA Report TID-26619,
    was prepared by the NIM Committee* of the United States Energy Research and Development
    Administration (now the Department of Energy)and the ESONE Committee** of European
    Laboratories. The corresponding ESONE document is ESONE/RTB/02.IEEE Std 726-1979
    differs from the corresponding ESONE document ESONE/RTB/02 and US Energy Research
    and Development Administration document TID-26619 in the following respects:(1)
    The keyword RECEIVE is used in place of the keyword READ for process input.(2)
    The section on interrupt handling is not included. In particular, reference to
    the WHEN statement to link an event-name to an interrupt service routine has been
    deleted.(3) The capability of handling errors at run-time has been deleted.
