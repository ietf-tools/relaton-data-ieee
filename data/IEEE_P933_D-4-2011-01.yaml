abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines for the definition of a reliability program
    at nuclear generating stations and other nuclear facilities. The document emphasizes
    reliability programs during the operating phase of such facilities; however, the
    general approach applies to all phases (e.g., design, construction, start-up,
    operating, and decommissioning) of the facility.
