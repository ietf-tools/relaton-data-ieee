abstract:
- content: The problems of system grounding, that is, connection to ground of neutral,
    of the corner of the delta, or of the midtap of one phase, are covered. The advantages
    and disadvantages of grounded vs. ungrounded systems are discussed. Information
    is given on how to ground the system, where the system should be grounded, and
    how to select equipment for the ground of the neutral circuits. Connecting the
    frames and enclosures of electric apparatus, such as motors, switchgear, transformers,
    buses, cables, conduits, building frames, and portable equipment, to a ground
    system is addressed. The fundamentals of making the interconnection of a ground
    conductor system between electric equipment and the ground rods, water pipes,
    etc., are outlined. The problems of static electricity- how it is generated, what
    processes may produce it, how it is measured, and what should be done to prevent
    its generation or to drain the static charges to earth to prevent sparking-are
    treated. Methods of protecting structures against the effects of lightning are
    also covered. Obtaining a low-resistance connection to earth, use of ground rods,
    connections to water pipes, etc., are discussed. A separate chapter on electronic
    equipment is included.
