abstract:
- content: This standard defines the functions and features to be provided in substation
    intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) to accommodate critical infrastructure protection
    programs. The standard addresses security regarding the access, operation, configuration,
    firmware revision and data retrieval from an IED. It does not address communications
    for the purpose of power system protection (teleprotection).
