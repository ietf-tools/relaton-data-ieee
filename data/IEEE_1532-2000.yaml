abstract:
- content: The communication protocol described by IEEE Std 1149.1 (Standard Test
    Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture) has been adopted by this standard
    for providing standardized programming access and methodology for programmable
    integrated circuit devices. Devices that implement this standard shall first be
    compliant with IEEE Std 1149.1 used for testing purposes. A device, or set of
    devices implementing this standard may be programmed (written), read back, erased,
    and verified, singly or concurrently, with a standardized set of resources. Sample
    implementation and application details (which are not part of this standard) are
    included for illustrative purposes.
