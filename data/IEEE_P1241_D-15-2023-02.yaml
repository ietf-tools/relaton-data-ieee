abstract:
- content: The material presented in this standard is intended to provide common terminology
    and test methods for the testing and evaluation of analog-to-digital converters
    (ADCs). This standard considers only those ADCs whose output values are extracted
    (sampled) and then digitized at known time intervals. In general, this quantization
    is assumed to be nominally uniform (the input-output transfer curve is approximately
    a straight line) and the sampling is assumed to be at a nominally uniform rate.
    Some but not all of the test methods in this standard can be used for ADCs that
    are designed for non-uniform quantization.
