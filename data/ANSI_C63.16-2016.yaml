abstract:
- content: Expanded explanations, best practices, and guidance for avoiding the pitfalls
    associated with electrostatic discharge (ESD) testing to IEC and other international
    ESD standards are provided and should be considered a supplement to these standards,
    rather than a replacement. Unique ESD test procedures related to connecting charged
    peripherals to equipment in use are also included. ** Downloads file posted at
