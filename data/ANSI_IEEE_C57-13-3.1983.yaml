abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.13.3-2005 General and specific recommendations
    for grounding current and voltage transformer secondary circuits and cases of
    connected equipment are provided. The practices recommended apply to all transformers
    of this type, including capacitive voltage transformers and linear couplers, irrespective
    of primary voltage or whether the primary windings are connected to, or are in,
    power circuits or are connected in the secondary circuits of other transformers
    as auxiliary current or voltage transformers. The primary emphasis is personnel
    safety and proper performance of relays at power-line frequencies. The grounding
    and shielding of cables and other grounding considerations are not addressed.
