abstract:
- content: A set of ontologies with different abstraction levels that contain concepts,
    definitions, axioms, and use cases that assist in the development of ethically
    driven methodologies for the design of robots and automation systems is established
    by this standard. It focuses on the robotics and automation domain without considering
    any particular applications and can be used in multiple ways, for instance, during
    the development of robotics and automation systems as a guideline or as a reference
    “taxonomy” to enable clear and precise communication among members from different
    communities that include robotics and automation, ethics, and correlated areas.
    Users of this standard need to have a minimal knowledge of formal logics to understand
    the axiomatization expressed in Common Logic Interchange Format. Additional information
    can be found at https://standards.ieee.org/industry-connections/ec/autonomous-systems.html
