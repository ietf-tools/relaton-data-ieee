abstract:
- content: Software verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes determine whether
    the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that
    activity and whether the software satisfies its intended use and user needs. Software
    V&amp;V life cycle process requirements are specified for different software integrity
    levels. The scope of V&amp;V processes encompasses software-based systems, computer
    software, hardware, and interfaces. This standard applies to software being developed,
    maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental
    items]. The term software also includes firmware, microcode, and documentation.
    Software V&amp;V processes include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment,
    and testing of software products
