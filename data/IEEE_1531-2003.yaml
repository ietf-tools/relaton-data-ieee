abstract:
- content: Guidelines for specification of components, protection, and control of
    harmonic filters are provided. This guide applies to the use of 50 Hz and 60 Hz
    passive shunt power harmonic filters on low- and medium-voltage electric power
    systems. This document is the first guide specifically created for harmonic filters,
    although standards do presently exist for most of the components that are used
    in a filter. Applications including industrial low-voltage facilities, utility
    medium-voltage systems, and arc furnace installations are covered.
