abstract:
- content: The two standards, IEEE Std 279-1971 (ANSI N42.7-1972), Criteria for Protection
    Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, and IEEE Std 308-1974, Standard
    Criteria for Class IE Power Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, establish
    minimum requirements for the Class IE power and protection systems for nuclear
    reactors producing steam for electric power generation. These requirements include,
    but are not limited to, the capability for testing the Class IE power and protection
    systems. To develop tests and establish test procedures, an expansion and interpretation
    of the test capabilities specified in IEEE Std 279-1971 and IEEE Std 308-1974
    are necessary.
