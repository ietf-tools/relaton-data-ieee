abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Std 1003.1-200x defines a standard operating system interface and
    environment, including a command interpreter (or shell), and common utility programs
    to support applications portability at the source code level. It is intended to
    be used by both applications developers and system implementors. IEEE Std 1003.1-200x
    comprises four major components (each in an associated volume): 1. General terms,
    concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x, including
    utility conventions and C- language header definitions, are included in the Base
    Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x. 2. Definitions for system service
    functions and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming
    language, function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery,
    are included in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x. 3. Definitions
    for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services
    (a shell) and common utility programs for application programs are included in
    the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x. 4. Extended rationale
    that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, containing historical
    information concerning the contents of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x and why features were
    included or discarded by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale
    (Informative) volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x. The following areas are outside
    of the scope of IEEE Std 1003.1-200x: * Graphics interfaces * Database management
    system interfaces * Record I/O considerations * Object or binary code portability
    * System configuration and resource availability IEEE Std 1003.1-200x describes
    the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to applications
    developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed to achieve
    these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities
    that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications. The facilities provided
    in IEEE Std 1003.1-200x are drawn from the following base documents: * IEEE Std
    1003.1, 2004 Edition (POSIX-1) (incorporating IEEE Stds 1003.1-2001, 1003.1-2001/Cor
    1-2002 and 1003.1-2001/Cor 2-2004) * Open Group Technical Standard, 2006, Extended
    API Set Part 1 * Open Group Technical Standard, 2006, Extended API Set Part 2
    * Open Group Technical Standard, 2006, Extended API Set Part 3 * Open Group Technical
    Standard, 2006, Extended API Set Part 4 * ISO/IEC 9899:1999, Programming Languages
