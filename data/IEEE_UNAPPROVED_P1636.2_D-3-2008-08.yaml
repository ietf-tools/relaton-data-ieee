abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to promote and facilitate interoperability between
    components of automatic test systems. The standard facilitates the capture of
    maintenance action information associated with the removal, repair, and replacement
    of system components to maintain/support an operational system. The maintenance
    action information schema becomes a class of information that can be used within
    the SIMICA family of standards. The exchange format utilizes the XML formats.
