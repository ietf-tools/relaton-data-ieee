abstract:
- content: This document prescribes criteria that establish protection requirements
    for Class 1E power systems and equipment. It describes the purpose of and the
    means for obtaining protection from electrical and mechanical damage, or failures
    that can occur within a time period that is shorter than that required for operator
    action. It includes both design and documentation requirements. It does not include
    plant physical design requirements to protect against events such as pipe ehip,
    fire, dropped load, etc.
