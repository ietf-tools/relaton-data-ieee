abstract:
- content: Verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes determine whether the development
    products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity and
    whether the product satisfies its intended use and user needs. V&amp;V life cycle
    process requirements are specified for different integrity levels. The scope of
    V&amp;V processes encompasses systems, software, and hardware, and includes their
    interfaces. This standard applies to systems, software, and hardware being developed,
    maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), non developmental
    items]. The term software also includes firmware and microcode, and each of the
    terms system, software and hardware includes documentation. V&amp;V processes
    include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing of products.
