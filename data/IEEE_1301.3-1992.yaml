abstract:
- content: Dimension requirements are presented for subracks, plug-in units, printed
    boards, and backplanes to be used in conjunction with IEEE Std 1301-1991 and with
    a 2.5 mm connector as defined in IEC 48B (Central Office) 245. The general arrangement,
    dimensions, and environmental requirements are covered. This standard may be used
    with other IEEE Std 1301.x connector implementations in the subrack.<<ETX>>
