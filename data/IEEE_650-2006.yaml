abstract:
- content: Methods for qualifying static battery chargers and inverters for Class
    1E installations outside containment in nuclear power generating stations are
    described. These methods may also be used to qualify similar electronic equipment
    for use in applications outside containment, where specific standards for such
    equipment are not available. The qualification methods set forth employ a combination
    of type testing and analysis, the latter including a justification of methods,
    theories, and assumptions used. These procedures meet the requirements of IEEE
    Std 323-2003.
