abstract:
- content: This standard specifies requirements and guidelines, for the design of
    radio frequency (RF) brain imaging systems, to help protect subjects/users/patients
    from adverse effects from overexposure to RF electromagnetic energy, and from
    other electrical, mechanical, chemical, and biological hazards. This standard
    is limited to brain imaging devices using a brain machine interface (BMI) that
    intentionally couples low-level RF electromagnetic energy, in the frequency range
    between 10 MHz and 20 GHz, into the human head using antennas or probes in direct
    6 contact with, or close proximity to, the human head.
