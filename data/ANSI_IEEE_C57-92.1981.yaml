abstract:
- content: General recommendations for loading mineral-oil-immersed power transformers
    and other oil-insulated power transformer having up to and including 100 MVA maximum
    nameplate rating are covered. They are based mostly on aging of the winding insulation.
    This guide may also be used for askarel-filled transformers. The method used for
    computer calculation of the capability tables for normal and moderate sacrifice
    of life and examples for developing them by hand calculations are given.
