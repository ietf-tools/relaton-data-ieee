abstract:
- content: Uniform procedures are established for manual and automatic measurement
    of audible noise from overhead transmission lines. Their purpose is to allow valid
    evaluation and comparison of the audible noise performance of various overhead
    lines. Definitions are provided, and instruments are specified. Measurement procedure
    are set forth, and precautions are given. Supporting data that should accompany
    the measurement data are specified, and methods for presenting the latter are
    described.
