abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a single source of implementation instructions
    that, when used with related recommended practices concerning unique identification
    principles and definitions, component function identifiers, and system descriptions,
    provide a basis for uniquely identifying systems, structures, and components of
    nuclear and fossil-fueled power plant projects (electric power generating stations)
    and related facilities. Hydro and other types of power plants are not included.
    The standard is part of a series of recommended practices, entitled the Energy
    Industry Identification Systems (EIIS), the purpose of which is to present a common
    language of communication which will permit a user to correlate a system, structure,
    or component with that of another organization for the purposes of reporting,
    comparison, or general communication. A significant feature of this concept is
    that the unique identification code identifies the function at the component level
    and not the hardware itself.
