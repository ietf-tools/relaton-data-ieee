abstract:
- content: 'Interface and functional requirements of cellular communication terminals
    installed on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are presented. The requirements are
    described in four categories: the terminals’ interface and functional requirements,
    data transmission requirements, environmental and reliability requirements, and
    safety requirements. The terminals’ functional requirements include the power
    management, cellular network communication, flight data and payload data collection,
    procession and transmission, device management, and safety management. The terminals’
    interface requirements are the requirements of the electrical interface and electromechanical
    interface. The electrical interface refers to the power supply interface, communication
    interface, human-machine interface, and antenna interface. Data transmission requirements
    are the flight data and payload data transmission requirements and terminals payload
    data safety requirements. Finally, the terminals’ interface environmental reliability
    and electromagnetic compatibility are presented.'
