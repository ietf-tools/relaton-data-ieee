abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is intended to identify, organize, and summarize
    information about ac high-voltage circuit breakers provided by the manufacturer
    that knowledgeable users will find useful for the receipt, installation, commissioning,
    operation and maintenance, and decommissioning of ac high-voltage circuit breakers
    above 1000 V. Recommended categories and an arrangement for the presentation of
    information in circuit breaker instruction manuals is covered in this recommended
    practice.
