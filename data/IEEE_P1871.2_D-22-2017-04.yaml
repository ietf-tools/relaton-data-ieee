abstract:
- content: 'This document is a recommended practice to extending the ATML exchange
    formats to for the purposes describing intrinsic paths. The recommended practice
    presents an XML schema an ATML instance document, and use cases related to intrinsic
    path characterizations. (NOTE: Additional files for this standard are available
    at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/1871/1871.2-2017/)'
