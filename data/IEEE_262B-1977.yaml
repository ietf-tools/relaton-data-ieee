abstract:
- content: 'This standard prescribes insulation levels and dielectric test requirements
    for power transformers where: (1) The transformer insulation levels and dielectric
    test requirements are specified to be in accordance with this standard. (2) The
    highest voltage winding of the transformer is wye connected and rated 345 kV or
    above. (3) The transformer is intended for operation on an effectively grounded
    system and is protected by suitable surge arresters.'
