abstract:
  content: 'Errata, corrections, and clarifications to IEEE Std 896.4-1993, as well
    as a new diskette version of the conformance test suite to replace the original
    test suite distributed with the 1993 publication of the standard, are provided.
    IEEE Std 896.4-1993 defines a suite of tests that govern the testing of the requirements
    of Futurebus+¨ as defined originally in IEEE Std 896.1-1991 and IEEE Std 896.2-1991.
    This supplement also updates IEEE Std 896.4-1993 so that the requirements of ISO/IEC
    10857: 1994 [ANSI/IEEE Std 896.1, 1994 Edition] and IEEE Std 896.2a-1994 are tested.'
