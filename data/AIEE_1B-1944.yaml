abstract:
- content: In the various standards there will be found a number of different situations
    regarding Usual Service Conditions. The following three are typical.1. The group
    where the maximum ambient temperature is specified. The Standards for Bushings,
    Fuses, Lightning Arresters, Protector Tubes and Potential Devices where 40 C ambient
    is used and Marine Equipment where 50 C ambient is used are typical of this group.2.
    The group where both the maximum and daily average temperatures of the cooling
    medium are specified. Standards for Transformers, Regulators and Neutral Grounding
    Devices are typical of this group.3. The group where a higher ambient temperature
    is specified for silver contacts than for copper contacts. Standards for Circuit
    Breakers, Air Switches and Switchgear Assemblies are typical of this group.It
    is suggested that a selection of one of the following groups can be made for the
    statement of Usual Service Conditions in most of the standards for specific equipment.
