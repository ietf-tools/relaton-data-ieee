abstract:
- content: Principles are given for the development of test procedures to evaluate
    the thermal endurance of solid electrical insulating materials and simple combinations
    of such materials. The results of accelerated thermal endurance tests, which are
    conducted according to prescribed procedures, may be used to establish temperature
    indexes for insulating materials. The test procedures apply to materials before
    they are fabricated into insulating structures identified with specific parts
    of electric equipment. Tests for specific insulating materials are not covered.
    The procedures may or may not apply to the aging characteristics of dielectric
    fluids or of porous materials impregnated with dielectric fluids.
