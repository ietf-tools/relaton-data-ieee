abstract:
- content: The base nomenclature provided in IEEE 11073 to support terminology for
    implantable cardiac devices is extended in this standard. Devices within the scope
    of this nomenclature are implantable devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators,
    devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy, and implantable cardiac monitors.
    The discrete terms necessary to convey a clinically relevant summary of the information
    obtained during a device interrogation are defined in this nomenclature. To improve
    workflow efficiencies, cardiology and electrophysiology practices require the
    management of summary interrogation information from all vendor devices and systems
    in a central system such as an Electronic Health Records (EHR) system or a device
    clinic management system. To address this requirement, the Implantable Device,
    Cardiac (IDC) Nomenclature defines a standard-based terminology for device data.
    The nomenclature facilitates the transfer of data from the vendor proprietary
    systems to the clinic EHR or device clinic management system.
