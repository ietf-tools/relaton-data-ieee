abstract:
  content: This document provides guidance for evaluation of the characteristics and
    performance of sodium-beta batteries by a potential user for stationary applications.
    Information regarding technology description, safety, aging and failure modes,
    evaluation techniques, and regulatory issues is included in this guide. This document
    is to be used in conjunction with IEEE Std 1679, IEEE Recommended Practice for
    the Characterization and Evaluation of Emerging Energy Storage Technologies in
    Stationary Applications. Sodium-beta batteries include those secondary (rechargeable)
    electro-chemistries with sodium as the active 8 species exchanged between the
    electrodes during charging and discharging, and operating above the melting point
    of sodium. These batteries use a solid beta-alumina electrolyte, typically written
    as &#946;’'-alumina. Examples of secondary sodium-beta batteries are sodium-metal
    chloride and sodium-sulfur batteries.
