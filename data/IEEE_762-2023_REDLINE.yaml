abstract:
- content: Outlined in this document are standardized terminology and indexes for
    reporting electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity
    performance measures that recognize the power industry’s needs, including marketplace
    competition. This standard also includes equations for equivalent demand forced
    outage rate (EFORd), newly identified outage states, energy weighted equations
    for group performance indexes, definitions of outside management control (OMC),
    pooling methodologies, and time-based calculations for group performance indexes.
    It includes consideration of variable energy resource units and resource unavailability
    and new indexes appropriate for that purpose.
