abstract:
- content: Transformers and inductors of both the saturating and non-saturating type
    are covered. The power transfer capability of the transformers and inductors covered
    ranges from less than 1 W to the multi-kilowatt level. The purpose is to provide
    a common basis between the engineers designing power conversion circuits and the
    engineers designing the transformers and inductors used in those circuits. Apparatus
    used in equipment for high-voltage power conversion for distribution by electric
    utilities is not covered.
