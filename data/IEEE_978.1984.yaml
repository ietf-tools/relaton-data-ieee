abstract:
  content: Recommendations for in-service inspection, maintenance, and electrical
    testing of live-line tools are provided. Both job-site and shop or laboratory
    procedures are covered. Only the electrical aspects are discussed, namely, ac,
    dc, high-potential test, and watts-loss procedures. All electrical values, unless
    otherwise stated, are 50 Hz--60 Hz rms values. Not all of the proven practical
    methods and procedures are included. However, the choice of methods is based on
    sound engineering principles, engineering safety considerations, decades of testing,
    and the field experiences of many utilities.
