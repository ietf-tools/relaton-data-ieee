abstract:
- content: This guide is developed to assist users in selecting the appropriate level
    of protection system redundancy for power system reliability based on the best
    industry practices. It defines protection system redundancy and examines the effect
    of protection system components on redundancy. Different concepts of redundancy
    as related to physical location, instrument transformer, relay scheme, and communication
    systems are discussed. Redundancy application considerations for various power
    system elements are presented. (An errata for this standard is available at https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/C37.120-2021_errata.pdf)
