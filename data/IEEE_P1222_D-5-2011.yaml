abstract:
- content: This standard covers the construction, mechanical, electrical and optical
    performance, installation guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements,
    and environmental considerations for an all-dielectric self-supporting fiber optic
    cable designed to be located on overhead electric power utility and telecommunications
    facilities. This does not include cables used for underground installations.
