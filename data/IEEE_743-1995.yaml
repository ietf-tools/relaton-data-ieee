abstract:
- content: Performance requirements for test equipment that measures the analog transmission
    parameters of subscriber loops, message trunks, PBX trunks, and ties lines are
    specified. Requirements for these measurements with DS1 bit stream access are
    also provided. The measurement of loss, noise, and impulse noise on non-loaded
    cable pairs used for digital subscriber lines is also addressed.
