abstract:
- content: This document supersedes IEEE Std 28-1972 (ANSI C62.1-1971) and revises
    many portions ofthe previous edition. Three new significant design tests have
    been added to determine:(1) The highest 1.2 x 50 standard impulse which the surge
    arrester will allow without sparkover(2) The effect of external contamination
    on sparkover(3) Surge arrester disconnector characteristics. Additional substantive
    changes include:(1) New definition of prorated section(2) Revision of Table 1
    to include a 25 kV distribution surge arrester and special ratings for rotatingmachine
    protection(3) Increase in maximum rate-of-rise for front-of-wave sparkover test(4)
    Expanded range of currents in the discharge voltage test(5) Reduced high current
    test for station surge arresters to 65 kA(6) Expanded Table 4 to include test
    values for 550 kV and 800 kV system surge arresters(7) General revision of pressure-relief
    test.
