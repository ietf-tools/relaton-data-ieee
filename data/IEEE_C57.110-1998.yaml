abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.110-2008. Methods are developed to conservatively
    evaluate the feasibility of supplying additional nonsinusoidal load currents from
    an existing installed dry-type or liquified transformer, as a portion of the total
    load. Clarification of the necessary application information is provided to assist
    in properly specifying a new transformer expected to carry a load, a portion of
    which is composed of nonsinusoidal load currents. A number of examples illustrating
    these methods and calculations are presented. Reference annexes make a comparison
    of the document calculations to calculations found in other industry standards
    and suggested temperature rise methods are detailed for reference purposes.
