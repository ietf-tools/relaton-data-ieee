abstract:
- content: This project will develop a Guide for the application of protective relays
    used for load shedding and restoration during electric power system abnormal frequency
    conditions. It will present background information, bibliography, and recommendations.
    It discusses abnormal frequency power system behavior, existing load shedding
    and restoration practices, the abnormal frequency function of typical protective
    relays, and possible new methods for improved load shedding and restoration. This
    project is limited to electric power system applications and will not include
    Abnormal Frequency Protection of Power Generating Plants.
