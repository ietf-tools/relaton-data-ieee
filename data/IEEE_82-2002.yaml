abstract:
- content: A test procedure for impulse testing of insulated conductors (cables) and
    cables with accessories installed (cable systems) is provided in this standard.
    This procedure can be used as a design or qualification test for cables or for
    cable systems. This test procedure is not intended to replace any existing or
    future standards covering cable or cable accessories, impulse generators, impulse
    testing, or voltage measurements. It is intended to supplement such standards
    by providing specific procedures for impulse testing on specific type of cables,
    accessories, or cable systems.
