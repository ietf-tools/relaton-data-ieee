abstract:
- content: 'This standard pertains to ferroresonant voltage regulators which operate
    at relatively constant frequencies and provide substantially constant output voltages
    in spite of relatively large changes of input voltage, and to controlled ferroresonant
    regulators which maintain substantially constant output voltages regardless of
    variations, within limits, of input voltage, temperature, frequency, and output
    load. Guides to application and test procedures are included. Provision is made
    for relating the characteristics of ferroresonant regulators to associated rectifiers
    and circuits. Definitions pertaining to ferroresonance and ferroresonant regulators
    which have not been found elsewhere are included with an appropriate discussion.
    This standard includes, but is not limited to, the following types of ferroresonant
    regulators: (1) Series ferroresonant regulators (2) Series-parallel ferroresonant
    regulators (electrically connected) (3) Ferroresonant transformer regulators (magnetically
    coupled) (4) Controlled ferroresonant regulators.'
