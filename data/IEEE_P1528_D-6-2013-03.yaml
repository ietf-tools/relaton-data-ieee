abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Std 1528-200X specifies protocols and test procedures for the measurement
    ofthe peak spatial-average SAR induced inside a simplified model of the head of
    users of certainhandheld radio transceivers. These transceivers are intended to
    be used for personal wirelesscommunications services, operate in the 300 MHz to
    6 GHz frequency range, and are intended tobe operated while held against the ear.
    The results obtained by following the protocols specifiedin this recommended practice
    represent a conservative estimate of the peak spatial-average SARinduced in the
    head of a significant majority of persons, subject to measurement and otheruncertainties
    that are defined in this standard. The results are representative of those expectedduring
    conditions of intended use of a handheld wireless device. It is not the intent
    of thisrecommended practice to provide a result representative of the absolute
    maximum SAR valuepossible under every conceivable combination of head size, head
    shape, handset orientation, andspacing relative to the head. The measurement of
    SAR induced in the external tissues of thehead, e.g., the external ear (pinna),
    is not addressed in this standard. This standard also does notaddress the body
    SAR measurements typically required for wireless handsets. The followingitems
    are described in detail: measurement concepts, measurement techniques, instruments,calibration
    techniques, simulated-tissue (phantom) models, including homogeneous anatomically-equivalent
    models of the human head and simple phantoms for validation of the SARmeasurement
    system, and the limitations of these systems when used for measuring the spatialpeakmass-averaged
    SAR. Procedures for calibrating electric field (E-field) probes used for SARmeasurements
    and assessing the SAR measurement and system uncertainties are provided inthe
    annexes. This recommended practice is intended primarily for use by engineers
    and otherspecialists who are familiar with electromagnetic (EM) theory and SAR
    measurement techniques.This standard does not recommend specific SAR limit values
    since these are found in otherdocuments. The benefits to the users include standardized
    and accepted protocols, validationtechniques, and means for estimating the overall
    measurement uncertainty in order to producevalid and repeatable data.'
