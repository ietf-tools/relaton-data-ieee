abstract:
- content: This guide applies the IEEE Standard 2030-2011 Smart Grid Interoperability
    Reference Model (SGIRM) process to energy storage, highlighting the information
    relevant to energy storage system interoperability with the EPS. The process can
    be applied to energy storage system applications located on customer premises,
    at the distribution level, and bulk storage on the transmission level. This guide
    provides useful industry derived definitions for ESS characteristics, applications
    and terminology. This simplifies the task of defining the systems communication
    and IT requirements. It also results in these system requirements being communicated
    more clearly and consistently in the project specifications.This guide also presents
    a methodology that can be used for most common ESS projects to describe the power
    system, communications, and IT perspectives in a simplified and standardized format
    based on the IEEE Std. 2030-2011 definitions. This provides a clear framework
    in which emerging cyber security requirements can be incorporated as appropriate.
    Once the power system, communications, and IT perspectives are defined, a clearer
    picture and understanding is developed of this seemingly complex system and provides
    a common base for all project stakeholders to understand. Additionally, this guide
    provides the templates that can be used to develop requirements for an ESS project
    and goes through several real world ESS project examples step-by-step.
