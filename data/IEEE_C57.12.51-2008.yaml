abstract:
- content: Characteristics relating to performance, limited electrical and mechanical
    interchangeability, as well as safety of the equipment described, and to assist
    in the proper selection of such equipment, are set forth in this standard. Specific
    rating combinations are described in the range from 750/1000 kVA to 7500/10 000
    kVA inclusive, with high-voltage 601 V to 34 500 V inclusive and low-voltage 208Y/120
    V to 4160 V inclusive. This standard describes certain electrical and mechanical
    requirements and takes into consideration certain safety features of 60 Hz, two-winding,
    three-phase, ventilated dry-type transformers with self-cooled ratings 501 kVA
    and larger, which are generally used for step-down purposes. Clause 9 through
    Clause 11 describe other requirements or alternatives that may be specified for
    some applications and lists forced-air-cooled ratings for certain sizes.
