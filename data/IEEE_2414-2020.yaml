abstract:
- content: This standard would fulfill the lack of uniformity by defining all terms
    involved in jitter definition, by identifying all jitter components and by modelling
    them. In this standard a new definition and modelling framework is presented with
    the aim to be coherent as much as possible with existent standards. In particular,
    models and definition are given for jitter, timing jitter, timing error, time
    interval error, period jitter, cycle-to-cycle jitter, random jitter, wander, deterministic
    jitter, data-dependent jitter, periodic jitter, bounded uncorrelated jitter, DJ
    model total jitter, RMS and peak-to-peak jitter; bit-error rate, phase noise.
