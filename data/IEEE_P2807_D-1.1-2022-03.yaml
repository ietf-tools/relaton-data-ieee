abstract:
- content: A framework of knowledge graphs is proposed in this standard. The knowledge
    graph conceptual model, construction and integration process of knowledge graphs,
    main activities in the processes, and stakeholders of knowledge graphs are described
    in detail. This standard can be applied in various organizations that plan, design,
    develop, implement, and apply knowledge and in organizations that develop support
    technologies, tools, and services to knowledge graphs.
