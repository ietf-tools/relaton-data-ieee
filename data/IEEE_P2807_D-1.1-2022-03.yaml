abstract:
- content: A framework of knowledge graphs is proposed in this standard. This standard
    describes the knowledge graph conceptual model, the construction and integration
    process of knowledge graphs, main activities in the processes and stakeholders
    of knowledge graphs in detail. This standard can be applied in various organizations
    which plan, design, develop, implement, and apply knowledge and organizations
    which develop support technologies, tools, and services to knowledge graphs.
