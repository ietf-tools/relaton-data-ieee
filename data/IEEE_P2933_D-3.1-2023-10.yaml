abstract:
- content: This standard establishes a framework with TIPPSS principles (Trust, Identity,
    Privacy, Protection, Safety, Security) for Clinical Internet of Things (IoT) data
    and device interoperability. This includes wearable clinical IoT and interoperability
    with healthcare systems including Electronic Health Records (EHR), Electronic
    Medical Records (EMR), other clinical IoT devices, in-hospital devices, and future
    devices and connected healthcare systems.
