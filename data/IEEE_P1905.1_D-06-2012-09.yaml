abstract:
- content: '1905.1 defines an abstraction layer for multiple home networking technologies
    that provides a common interface to widely deployed home networking technologies:
    IEEE 1901 over power lines, IEEE 802.11 for wireless, Ethernet over twisted pair
    cable and MoCA 1.1 over coax. The 1905.1 abstraction layer supports connectivity
    selection for transmission of packets arriving from any interface or application.
    The 1905.1 layer does not require modification to the underlying home networking
    technologies and hence does not change the behavior or implementation of existing
    home networking technologies. 1905.1 specification introduces a layer between
    layers 2 and 3 that abstracts the individual details of each interface, aggregates
    available bandwidth, and facilitates seamless integration. This layer simplifies
    setup, for example, by eliminating the need for a user to enter different passwords
    to access each of the links. The 1905.1 also facilitates end-to-end quality of
    service (QoS) while simplifying the introduction of new devices to the network,
    establishing secure connections, extending network coverage, and facilitates advanced
    network management features including discovery, path selection, auto configuration
    and Quality of Service (QoS) negotiation.'
