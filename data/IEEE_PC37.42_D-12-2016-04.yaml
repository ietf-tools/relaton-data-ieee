abstract:
- content: 'Specifications for high voltage (above 1000 volts) Class A and Class B
    expulsion and current-limiting fuses. This includes: a) Expulsion type Class A
    [distribution class] fuses, fuse cutouts, fuse disconnecting switches, their associated
    fuse links or refill units, disconnecting cutouts, and accessories for these devices
    with rated voltages from 1 through 38 kV. b) Expulsion type Class B [power class]
    fuses, fuse disconnecting switches, their associated fuse links or refill units,
    disconnecting cutouts, and accessories for these devices with rated voltages from
    1 through 170 kV. c) Class A and Class B current-limiting fuses and accessories
    for these devices with rated voltages 1 through 38 kV. d) Distribution and power
    class expulsion, current-limiting, and combination-type external capacitor fuses
    and accessories, with rated voltages from 1 kV through 38 kV, for protecting shunt
    capacitors complying with IEEE Std 18 and NEMA CP 1. e) Any of the above devices
    used in fuse enclosure packages. f) All of these devices are intended for use
    on alternating current distribution systems.'
