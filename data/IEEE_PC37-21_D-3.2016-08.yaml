abstract:
- content: This standard covers ratings, construction, and testing of dead-front control
    switchboards containing, but not limited to, devices such as switches, control
    devices, instrumentation, metering, monitoring, alarms, annunciators, protective
    and auxiliary relays, and regulating devices and accessories. It includes, but
    is not specifically limited to, switchboards for the control and protection of
    apparatus used for or associated with power generation, conversion, transmission,
    and distribution. Types of switchboards may include control, vertical, dead-front,
    enclosed, dual, or duplex switchboards. Other construction types include control
    desks, consoles, benchboards, dual or duplex benchboards, fixed rack, cabinet,
    and swing rack cabinets. It does not apply to industrial controls, communication
    equipment, switchboards for use on board ships, or Class 1E switchboards for use
    in nuclear generating stations.
