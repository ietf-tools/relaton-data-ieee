    Std 802.3ab-1999, and IEEE Std 802.3ad-2000. Superseded by 802.3-2002 (802.3ag).
    The media access control characteristics for the Carrier Sense Multiple Access
    with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) access method for shared medium local area
    networks are described. The control characteristics for full duplex dedicated
    channel use are also described. Specifications are provided for MAU types 1BASE5
    at 1 Mb/s; Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) and MAU types 10BASE5, 10BASE2, FOIRL
    (fiber optic inter-repeater link), 10BROAD36, 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL, 10BASE-FB,
    and 10BASE-FP at 10 Mb/s; Media Independent Interface (MII) and PHY types 100BASE-T4,
    100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, and 100BASE-T2 at 100 Mb/s; and the Gigabit MII (GMII)
    and 1000BASE-X PHY types, 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, and 1000BASE-CX, which operate
    at 1000 Mb/s (Gigabit Ethernet) as well as PHY type 1000BASE-T. Repeater specifications
    are provided at each speed. Full duplex specifications are provided at the Physical
    Layer for 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL, 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, 100BASE-T2, and Gigabit
    Ethernet. System considerations for multi-segment networks at each speed and management
    information base (MIB) specifications and additions to support Virtual Bridged
    Local Area Networks (VLANs) as specified in IEEE P802.1Q are also provided. Also
    specified is an optional Link Aggregation sublayer which multiple physical links
    to be aggregated together to form a single logical link.
