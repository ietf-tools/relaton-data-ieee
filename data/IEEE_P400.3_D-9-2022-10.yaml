abstract:
- content: The diagnostic testing of new or service-aged, installed shielded power
    cable systems, which include cable, joints, and terminations, using electrical
    partial discharge (PD) detection, measurement, and location is covered by this
    guide. PD testing, which is a useful indicator of insulation degradation, may
    be carried out online or by means of an external voltage source. The testing of
    compressed gas insulated cable or termination systems is not covered by this guide.
