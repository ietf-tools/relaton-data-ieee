abstract:
- content: This standard contains performance specifications and testing methods for
    the evaluation of hand-held instruments (also known as Radionuclide Identification
    Devices or RIDs) for the detection and identification of radionuclides, which
    emit gamma rays and, in some cases, neutrons. The specifications for general,
    radiological, environmental, electromagnetic and mechanical performances are given
    and the corresponding testing methods are described. The documentation to be provided
    by the manufacturer is listed as part of the requirements. This document also
    contains a number of normative and informative annexes that provide guidance in
    the implementation of this standard.
