abstract:
- content: The operation, functions, and attributes of a parallel system bus (PSB),
    called MULTIBUS II, are defined. A high- performance backplane bus intended for
    use in multiple-microprocessor systems, the PSB incorporates synchronous, 32-bit
    multiplexed address/data, with error detection, and uses a 10 MHz bus clock. This
    design is intended to provide reliable state- of-the-art operation and to allow
    the implementation of cost-effective high-performance VLSI for the bus interface.
    Memory, I/O, message, and geographic address spaces are defined. Error detection
    and retry is provided for messages. The message-passing design allows a VLSI implementation,
    so that virtually all modules on the bus will utilize the bus at its highest performance32
    to 40 Mbyte/s. An overview of PSB, signal descriptions, the PSB protocol, electrical
    characteristics, and mechanical specifications are covered. This document also
    contains IEEE Std 1101-1987, IEEE Standard for Mechanical Core Specifications
    for Microcomputers.
