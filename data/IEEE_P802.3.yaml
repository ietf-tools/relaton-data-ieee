abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2015 specifies new Physical Coding Sublayer
    interfaces and new Physical Medium Attachment sublayer interfaces for 25 Gb/s
    Ethernet and 40 Gb/s Ethernet. 25GBASE-T and 40GBASE-T specify LAN interconnects
    for up to 30 m of balanced twisted-pair structured cabling, for 25 Gb/s and 40
    Gb/s respectively.
