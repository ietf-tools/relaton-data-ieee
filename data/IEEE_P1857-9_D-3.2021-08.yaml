abstract:
- content: IEEE 1857.9 is working on the standard which provides efficient coding
    tool sets for compression, decompression, and reconstructing of the immersive
    visual content data. The target applications and services include but are not
    limited to virtual reality such as unmanned aerial vehicle-based VR, augment reality,
    panorama video, free-view TV, panoramic stereo video, and other video/audio-enabled
    services and applications such as immersive video streaming, broadcasting, storage
    and communication.
