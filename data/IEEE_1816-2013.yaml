abstract:
- content: Accepted best industry practices for the preparation of extruded dielectric
    shielded medium voltage cables rated 2.5 kV through 46 kV for the installation
    of mating accessories are defined in this guide. The information is intended to
    supplement cable accessory manufacturer installation instructions. The guide aims
    to provide a single source covering the proper methods to prepare cables for termination
    and jointing to maximize long-term, reliable operation of electrical power cable
    systems.
