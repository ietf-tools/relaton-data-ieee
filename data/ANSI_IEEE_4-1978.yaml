abstract:
- content: This IEEE standard establishes standard methods of measurement of HV and
    basic testing techniques for application to all types of apparatus. The first
    section defines terms and presents general requirements regarding tests. Section
    2 defines terms relating to the specific tests and describes methods for generation
    and measurement of voltages and currents. Section 3 provides definitions of terms
    related to the measurements. Section 4 provides information on measuring systems.
    Finally section 5 looks at the use of the sphere gap for the measurement of peak
    value.<<ETX>>
