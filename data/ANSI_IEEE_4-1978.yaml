abstract:
- content: Standard methods of measurement of high voltage and basic techniques for
    dielectrics, so far as they are generally applicable to all types of apparatus,
    for alternating voltages, direct voltages, lightning impulse voltages, switching
    impulse voltages, and impulse currents are established. General definitions and
    test requirements are provided, and test procedures and measuring devices are
    described. A measuring devices application guide and recommendations for voltage
    measurements by means of sphere gaps are included. The contents are based on and
    adhere very closely to IEC high- voltage test techniques documents.
