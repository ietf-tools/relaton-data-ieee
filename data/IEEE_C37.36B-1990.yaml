abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to aid air switch users in establishing suggested
    maximum values of excitation, resisted and capacitive currents that may be successfully
    interrupted while using outdoor air switches. This guide pertains to air switches
    mounted in the normal horizontal-upright position and not equipped with interrupting
    aids. (Superseded by IEEE Std C37.30.1-2011)
