abstract:
  content: Considerations for the pre-installation, installation, inspection, and
    testing of Class 1E power, instrumentation, and control equipment and systems
    of a nuclear facility while in the process of installing, inspecting, and testing
    during new construction, modification, or maintenance are provided in this recommended
    practice. This recommended practice does not apply to periodic surveillance testing.
    For purposes of this recommended practice, in addition to a nuclear power plant,
    a nuclear facility is defined as a facility related to the nuclear fuel cycle
    from fuel processing to reprocessing and waste management.
