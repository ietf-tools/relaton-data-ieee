abstract:
- content: The general information in this Guide is applicable to all forms of outdoor
    metal-enclosed switchgear. Specific data are given for outdoor metal-clad switchgear.
    The many combinations of sizes and ratings in similar housings make it impracticable
    to provide equivalent information for outdoor low-voltage metal-enclosed air circuit-breaker
    switchgear. Data are not yet available for specific recommendations for other
    switchgear equipment or components.
