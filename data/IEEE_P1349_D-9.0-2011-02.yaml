abstract:
- content: This guide was developed to assist individuals, organizations, and suppliers
    with the application of motors in Class I, Division 2 and Class I, Zone 2 locations,
    where flammable gases and vapors may occasionally be present. Three-phase and
    single-phase ac synchronous and induction electric motors, fractional through
    very large sizes, for sine wave and non-sine wave applications are covered in
    this guide. Primary emphasis is on the use of general-purpose enclosures and precautions
    against excessive surface temperatures and sparking. Surface temperature test
    methods and results of motor surface temperature tests and calculations performed
    by Working Group Member companies are documented in the guide. Guidance is included
    for selecting, operating, and maintaining motors in Class I, Division 2 and Class
    I, Zone 2 locations. Existing codes and standards contain cautionary notes for
    general-purpose motor applications in Class I, Division 2 and Class I, Zone 2
    areas. Industry experience and established practices are documented for the application
    of general-purpose motors in Class I, Division 2 and Class I, Zone 2 locations
    and guidance is given for applying motors in these locations. This guide is not
    a specification and is not intended for use as a specification for purchasing
    motors installed in Division 2 and Zone 2 locations.
