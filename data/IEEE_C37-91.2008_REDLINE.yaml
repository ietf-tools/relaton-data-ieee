abstract:
- content: This guide is intended to provide protection engineers and other readers
    with guidelines for protecting three-phase power transformers of more than 5 MVA
    rated capacity and operating at voltages exceeding 10 kV. In some cases, a user
    may apply the techniques described in this guide for protecting transformers of
    less than 5 MVA ratings or operating at voltages less than 10 kV. Information
    to assist protection engineers in applying properly relays and other devices to
    protect transformers used in transmission and distribution systems is provided
    in this guide. General philosophy, practical applications, and economic considerations
    involved in power transformer protection are discussed. Emphasis is placed on
    practical applications. Types of faults in transformers are described. Technical
    problems with the protection systems, including the behavior of current transformers
    during system faults, are discussed. Associated problems, such as fault clearing
    and reenergization, are discussed as well.

- content: Revision of IEEE Std C37.91-2000. This guide is intended to provide protection
    engineers and other readers with guidelines for protecting three-phase power transformers
    of more than 5 MVA rated capacity and operating at voltages exceeding 10 kV. In
    some cases, a user may apply the techniques described in this guide for protecting
    transformers of less than 5 MVA ratings or operating at voltages less than 10
    kV. The guide provides information to assist protection engineers in applying
    properly relays and other devices to protect transformers used in transmission
    and distribution systems. General philosophy, practical applications, and economic
    considerations involved in power transformer protection are discussed. Emphasis
    is placed on practical applications. Types of faults in transformers are described.
    Technical problems with the protection systems, including the behavior of current
    transformers (CTs) during system faults, are discussed. Associated problems, such
    as fault clearing and re-energization, are discussed as well.
