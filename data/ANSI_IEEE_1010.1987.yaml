abstract:
  content: 'Superseded by IEEE Std 1010-2006 Abstract: The control and monitoring
    requirements for equipment and systems associated with conventional and pumped-storage
    hydroelectric plants are described. Typical methods of local and remote control,
    details of the control interfaces for plant equipment, requirements for centralized
    and off-site control, and trends in control systems are included. The various
    categories that affect the levels of control for a plant, namely, location, mode,
    and supervision, are described. Block diagrams and descriptions of the control
    and monitoring requirements for major plant systems and equipment are given. Control
    sequencing of generating and pumped storage units, centralized control, and off-site
    control are covered. The information is directed toward practicing engineers in
    the field of power plant design who have a basic knowledge of hydroelectric facilities.'
