abstract:
- content: The various important aspects that need to be considered for satisfactory
    long-term performance of room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubber high-voltage
    insulator coatings (HVIC) are outlined in the guide. Methods of application, pre-coated
    applications, maintenance issues on coated applications, factors aff ecting long-term
    performance, erosion resistance, temporary loss of hydrophobicity, aging, laboratory
    accelerated tests, partially coated insulation, and functional outdoor evaluation
    are described.
