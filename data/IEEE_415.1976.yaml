abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance for preoperational testing of Class 1E
    Power systems for nuclear-power generating stations. The extent of the system
    shall be that covered by IEEE Std 308-1974, "Standard Criteria for Class 1E Power
    Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations." The power systems include both
    AC and DC supplies but do not include the equipment which utilizes the AC and
    DC power.
