abstract:
- content: This recommended practice describes interconnections that need to be understood
    and evaluated when buying, building, testing, or using computer-aided software
    engineering (CASE) tools. CASE tools are developed for use in creating computing
    systems. By assisting users to reach a clear understanding of the context of operation
    for a computing system tool, this recommended practice contributes to the effective
    implementation and application of computing system tools. This recommended practice
    does not describe the processes of evaluating, acquiring, or adopting CASE tools.
    This recommended practice is limited to the technical aspects of CASE tools. It
    does not include issues in the management, marketing, or training domains.

- content: 'Interconnections that need to be understood and evaluated when buying,
    building, testing, or using Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools are
    described in this recommended practice. This recommended practice is intended
    to help people interconnect tools by identifying and characterizing various contexts
    for tool interconnection. Each context serves to define a group of interconnections
    pertinent to various functional perspectives. Each group contains interconnections
    that have a common kind of endpoint in the environment. This recommended practice
    considers four contexts: an organizational context for a tool, the individual
    user context for a tool, the platform context for a tool, and a peer context for
    a tool. Within a context, subsets of interconnections are characterized by a collection
    of common features applicable to a given functional perspective. The purpose of
    this recommended practice is to establish sets of interconnection features with
    which each perspective on a CASE tool''s interconnections can be characterized.'
