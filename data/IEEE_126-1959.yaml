abstract:
- content: The Recommended Specifications consist of four sections. Specification
    Sections II, III and IV are complete purchase specifications. They cover alternate
    arrangements and performance requirements of speed-governing systems for internal
    combustion engine-generator units. These are printed as individual forms. T o
    gain the maximum benefit from these standards, particularly under normal conditions,
    it is recommended that the applicable section be included in full and as a part
    of the complete purchase specifications for the particular engine-generator unit.
    The Terminology, Section I, includes definitions and applications of terms and
    some explanatory comments. Pertinent portions of Section I, while not ordinarily
    transcribed in full, are made an integral part of each speed-governing specification
    as indicated in paragraphs 2 of Specification Sections II, III, and IV.
