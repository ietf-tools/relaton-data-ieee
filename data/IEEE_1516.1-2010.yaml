abstract:
- content: The High Level Architecture (HLA) has been developed to provide a common
    architecture for distributed modeling and simulation. The HLA defines an integrated
    approach that provides a common framework for the interconnection of interacting
    simulations. This document, the second in a family of three related HLA documents,
    defines the standard services of and interfaces to the HLA runtime infrastructure
    (RTI). These services are used by the interacting simulations to achieve a coordinated
    exchange of information when they participate in a distributed federation. The
    standards contained in this architecture are interrelated and need to be considered
    as a product set, when changes are made. They each have value independently.
