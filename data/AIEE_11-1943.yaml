abstract:
- content: In undertaking the preparation of rules for standards for rotating electrical
    equipment for railway cars and locomotives under the Rules of Procedure of the
    Ameri­can Standards Association, it has been necessary to cover a much wider field
    than was included in the AIEE Standards for Railway Motors which were published
    in 1925, approved as American Standards in 1928 and form the basis of this standard.
    In the first place, the scope of the rules has been changed to include all rotating
    electrical machinery forming a part of the power equip­ment of electrically-propelled
    railway cars and locomo­tives (including trolley, gasoline-electric and oil-electric
    coaches). In the second place, it has been found desirable to add new rules covering
    principally, rating, commuta­tion, and over speed tests. In the third place, the
    old rules must be brought up-to-date as modern methods of ventilating electrical
    machinery have changed the situa­tion in many respects. It is therefore felt necessary
    that some explanatory notes should be added to the rules in order to give the
    users of the rules a clearer understand­ing of the reasons for them.
