abstract:
- content: 'POSIX.1-2024 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1&#8482;-2024 and The Open
    Group Standard Base Specifications, Issue 8. POSIX.1-2024 defines a standard operating
    system interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or “shell”),
    and common utility programs to support applications portability at the source
    code level. POSIX.1-2024 is intended to be used by both application developers
    and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated
    volume): --General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this
    standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are
    included in the Base Definitions volume. --Definitions for system service functions
    and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language,
    function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are
    included in the System Interfaces volume. --Definitions for a standard source
    code-level interface to command interpretation services (a “shell”) and common
    utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities
    volume. --Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document
    structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of POSIX.1-2024
    and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included
    in the Rationale (Informative) volume.'
