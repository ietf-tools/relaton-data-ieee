abstract:
  content: This standard specifies electronic data interchange formats for blank ballot
    distribution, primarily to assist in satisfying the needs of the UOCAVA (Uniformed
    and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) and MOVE (Military and Overseas Voter
    Empowerment) Acts. Subsequent standards will address other requirements for electronic
    data interchange formats used by components of voting systems for exchange of
    electronic data. This scope does not include return of cast ballots by electronic
    means. The P1622 Voting Equipment Electronic Data Interchange Committee produces
    this standard.
