abstract:
- content: 'This recommended practice presents engineering design practices for special
    high-voltage protection systems intended to protect wire-line telecommunication
    facilities serving electric supply locations. The following topics are included
    in this document: a) A description of the electric supply locations environment,
    i.e., ground potential rise (GPR), induced voltages, lightning, and switching
    transients; b)A discussion of special high-voltage protection devices; c)Definitions
    of service types and service performance objectives for electric supply locations
    telecommunication services; d)Special protection theory and philosophy; e)Special
    protection system design guidelines; f)Personnel safety considerations; g)Grounding;
    h)Cables with metallic members. Other telecommunication alternatives such as radio
    and optica fiber systems are excluded from this document.'
