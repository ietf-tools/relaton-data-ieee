abstract:
- content: A set of procedures to be followed to cope with reradiation of AM broadcast
    signals from power lines and other large metallic structures is provided. Reradiation
    may be described as electromagnetic waves radiated from a structure that has parasitically
    picked up a signal from the environment. A simplified prediction technique called
    a survey is described to determine which structures could possibly cause a problem.
    Guidelines for measurements and data analysis are included.
