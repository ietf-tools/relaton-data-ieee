abstract:
- content: For Personal Health Devices (PHDs) and Point-of-Care Devices (PoCDs), a
    security baseline of application layer cybersecurity mitigation techniques is
    defined by this standard for certain use cases or for times when certain criteria
    are met. The mitigation techniques are based on an extended confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability (CIA) triad and are described generally to allow manufacturers
    to determine the most appropriate algorithms and implementations. A scalable information
    security toolbox appropriate for PHD/PoCD interfaces is specified that fulfills
    the intersection of requirements and recommendations from the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the European Network and Information Security
    Agency (ENISA). A mapping of this standard to the NIST cybersecurity framework;
    IEC TR 80001-2-2; and the Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure,
    Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege (STRIDE) classification scheme is
    defined.
