abstract:
- content: This standard provides guidance on how to verify Electromagnetic Compatibility
    (EMC) test performance through the use of statistical process control (SPC) and
    specialized setups. By employing SPC a laboratory can monitor the validity of
    tests by recording data in such a way that trends are detectable and an assessment
    of test system stability can be made. Laboratory quality checks that use SPC are
    a powerful tool to provide confidence to both the laboratory and its customer
    that test results will be correct.
