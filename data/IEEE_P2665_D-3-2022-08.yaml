abstract:
- content: Guidance is provided on how to verify electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
    test performance through the use of statistical process control (SPC) and examples
    of setups. Employing SPC, the validity of tests can be monitored by a laboratory
    by recording data in such a way that trends are detectable, and an assessment
    of test system stability can be made. Laboratory quality checks that use SPC are
    a powerful tool to provide confidence, to both the laboratory and its customer,
    that test results will be correct.
