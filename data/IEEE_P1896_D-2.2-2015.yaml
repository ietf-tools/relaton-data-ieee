abstract:
- content: This standard defines the parameters to be used in the identification of
    contact wires used in transit systems and electric railways and railroads. This
    standard is intended for use in identifying contact wire by metallurgical content,
    electrical conductivity and agency ownership. This standard is not intended to
    replace or supersede existing identification standards using grooving but rather
    to simplify identification methods.
