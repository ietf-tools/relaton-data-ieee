abstract:
- content: This document describes the basic requirements for qualifying Class IE
    equipment and interfaces that are to be used in nuclear power generating stations.
    The requirements presented include the principles, procedures, and methods of
    qualification. These qualification requirements, when met, will confirm the adequacy
    of the equipment design under normal, abnormal, design basis event, post design
    basis event, and containment test conditions for the performance of Class IE functions.
