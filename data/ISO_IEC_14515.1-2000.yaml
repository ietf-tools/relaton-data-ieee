abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14515-1:2000(E) (IEEE Std 2003.1-1992) provides a definition of
    the requirements placed upon providers of POSIX test methods for POSIX.1 (ISO/IEC
    9945-1:1990; IEEE Std 1003.1-1990). These requirements consist of a POSIX.1-ordered
    list of assertions defining those aspects of POSIX.1 that are to be tested and
    the associated test methods that are to be used in performing those tests. This
    standard is aimed primarily at POSIX.1 test suite providers and POSIX.1 implementors.
    This standard specifies those aspects of POSIX.1 that shall be verified by conformance
    test methods.
