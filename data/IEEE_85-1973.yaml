abstract:
- content: 'This test procedure defines approved methods for conducting tests and
    reporting results to effect the uniform determination of rotating electric machine
    sound under steady-state conditions with an accuracy of +or-3 dB tested in three
    acoustical environments. These are: free field; reverberant field; and semireverberant
    field. This procedures assumes the presence of pure tones or the predominance
    of discrete frequencies in the sound spectrum.<<ETX>>'
