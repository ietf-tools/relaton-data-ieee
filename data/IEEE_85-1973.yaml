abstract:
- content: 'Approved methods for conducting tests and reporting results to effect
    the uniform determination of rotating-electric-machine sound under steady-state
    conditions with an accuracy of 3 dB are defined. Three acoustical environments
    are considered: free field, reverberant field, and semireverberant field. Installation
    and operation of the machine is discussed. The test procedure assumes the presence
    of pure tones or the predominance of discrete frequencies in the sound spectrum.'
