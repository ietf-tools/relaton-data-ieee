abstract:
- content: Provides guidance for determining the hottest-spot temperature in distribution
    and power transformers built in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000. Describes
    the important criteriato be evaluated by any thermal model that can accurately
    predict the hottest-spot temperature in atransformer. Provides guidance for performing
    temperature-rise tests with direct measurement of the hottest-spot temperatures,
    and explains the importance of developing an accurate thermal model to properly
    locate the temperature sensors.
