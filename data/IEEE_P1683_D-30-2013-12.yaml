abstract:
- content: This guide provides functional design recommendations and field practices
    for Motor Control Centers (single and three phase 50 and 60 Hz and dc). The features
    and practices described in this guide are intended to help reduce the probability
    that an incident will occur due to shock or arc flash hazards when qualified persons
    are performing certain activities. The recommendations within this guide are intended
    to augment the existing requirements of applicable standards for motor control
    centers, e.g., NEMA ICS 18 Motor Control Centers, ANSI/UL845 Motor Control Centers,
    NMX-J-353-ANCE, and CSA C22.2 No. 254. This guide also provides recommendations
    for interface relationships between the specifier, manufacturer, installer, and
    user for safety related concerns. It also provides a framework from which specifiers/users
    can select specific MCC features and system characteristics that are applicable
    to their specific situation and needs. TThe recommendations in this guide complement
    safety requirements and procedures as stipulated by workplace safety standards
    and site practices and site procedures, e.g., NFPA 70E Standard for Electrical
    Safety in the Workplace, CSA Z462 Workplace Electrical Safety Standard, site practice
    on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), etc.
