abstract:
- content: It has been common practice for a long time in this country to ground the
    secondary circuits and cases of most instrument transformers used in switching
    stations, substations and generating stations and in certain other types of installations
    for reasons of safety to personnel and equipment. The object of the grounding
    is to limit the voltage on the secondary circuits and cases due to the effects
    of (1) possible insulation failure or other accidental contact between the primary
    circuit and the secondary circuit and/or case, which can subject them to full
    primary voltage, and (2) the capacitive coupling! between the primary and secondary
    circuit and case, which may impart to the secondary circuit and/or case objectionable
    or dangerous voltages to ground. However, there has been no general agreement
    among manufacturers and users whether all such instrument transformers, including
    auxiliary transformers, irrespective of voltage, should be grounded or just how
    this grounding should be done. The object of this Guide, based to a large extent
    on the findings and conclusions contained in a report by the AIEE Relay Committee
    titled Grounding of Instrument Transformer Secondary Circuits'' published in the
    April 1947 issue of Electrical Engineering, is to give recommendations in this
    respect.This Guide contains general and specific recommendations for grounding
    of the secondary circuits and cases of instrument, i.e., potential and current,
    transformers in all types of installations. These recommendations apply to all
    instrument transformers irre-spective of the value of primary voltage or whether
    the primary windings of the transformers are connected to, or in, power circuits
    or whether these primary windings are connected in the secondary circuits of other
    instrument transformers. Exceptions to grounding are permissible where the advantages
    obtained by not grounding in certain instances or in certain types of installations
    are considered to outweigh the safety or other advantages obtained by grounding.
    However, such exceptions should be made only (1) when the instrument transformers
    form part of a separate metering or network installation and not part of a switching
    station, substation or generating station, and (2) when the primary windings are
    connected to circuits of 600 volts or less. Furthermore, for reasons of increased
    safety in those metering or network installations where the instrument transformers
    or live parts of the secondary circuit are accessible to other than authorized
    personnel, (1) the exceptions to the grounding of the secondary circuits should
    be made only if the voltage of the primary circuit is 300 volts or less to ground
    and (2) the exceptions to the grounding of the cases should be made only if the
    voltage of the primary circuit is 150 volts or less to ground.
