abstract:
- content: This standard applies to shunts for use in direct current circuits to extend
    the range of instruments or other measuring devices. This standard may apply with
    suitable exceptions to shunts constructed for special requirements; for example,
    those having unusually high or low current ratings or voltage drops, special or
    unusual ranges, and nonstandard terminal arrangements for special applications.<<ETX>>
