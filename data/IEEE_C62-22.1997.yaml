abstract:
- content: The application of metal-oxide surge arresters to safeguard electric power
    equipment against the hazards of abnormally high voltage surges of various origins
    is covered. Step-by- step directions toward proper solutions of various applications
    are provided. In many cases, the prescribed steps are adequate. More complex and
    special solutions requiring study by experi- enced engineers are described, but
    specific solutions are not always given. The procedures are based on theoretical
    studies, test results, and experience.
