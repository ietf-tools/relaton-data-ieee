abstract:
- content: This guide provides reference information to assist electric utilities
    and their contractors with the development of computer-based means for collecting
    and managing transmission line inspection and maintenance data and associated
    asset information including transmission line inventory data. It provides a high
    level overview of key principles and considerations learned through experience
    that will help ensure common pitfalls are avoided and enhance the usability of
    systems. It is not intended to provide an exhaustive discussion of the many details
    and specifics that must be accounted for when designing and developing a system
    for an individual utilitys application and needs.
