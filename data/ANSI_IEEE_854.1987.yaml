abstract:
  content: A family of commercially feasible ways for new systems to perform floating-point
    arithmetic is defined. This standard specifies constraints on parameters defining
    values of basic and extended floating-point numbers; add, subtract, multiply,
    divide, square root, remainder, and compare operations; conversions between integers
    and floating-point numbers; conversions between different floating-point precisions;
    conversion between basic precision floating-point numbers and decimal strings;
    and floating-point exceptions and their handling, including nonnumbers. It is
    intended that an implementation of a floating-point system conforming to this
    standard can be realized entirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in any
    combination of software and hardware. Retrofitting issues are not considered.
