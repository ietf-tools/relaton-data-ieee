abstract:
- content: This standard applies to outdoor and indoor composite station post insulators
    used in HVDC power transmission systems. The composite station post insulators
    covered by this standard consist of a load-bearing insulating core (or tube),
    a housing (outside the insulating solid core or tube) made of elastomer material
    (e.g., silicone or ethylene-propylene) and end fittings attached to the insulating
    core (or tube).
