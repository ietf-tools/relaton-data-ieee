abstract:
- content: This document defines accepted best industry practices for the preparation
    of extruded dielectric shielded medium voltage cables rated 2.5 kV through 46
    kV for the installation of mating accessories. The information is intended to
    supplement cable accessory manufacturer installation instructions. The guide aims
    to provide a single source covering the proper methods to prepare cables for termination
    and jointing to maximize long term, reliable operation of electrical power cable
    systems.
