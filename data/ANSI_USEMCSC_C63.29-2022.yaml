abstract:
- content: U.S. consensus standard methods, instrumentation, and facilities for measurement
    of radio-frequency (RF) signals and noise emitted from lighting equipment in the
    frequency range from 9 kHz to 40 GHz are specified. Generic nor product-specific
    emission limits are not included in this standard. Where possible, the specifications
    herein are harmonized with other national and international standards used for
    similar purposes.
