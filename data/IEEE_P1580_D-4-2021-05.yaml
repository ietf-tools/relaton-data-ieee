abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is for single or multiconductor cables, with
    or without metal armor and/or jacket, and rated 300 V to 35 kV AC (RMS phase-to-phase)
    or up to 2000 V DC, intended to be installed aboard marine vessels, fixed and
    floating offshore facilities, and in accordance with industry installation standards
    and the regulations of the authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ). The recommendations
    define what is considered good engineering practice with reference to the reliability
    and durability of the cable.
