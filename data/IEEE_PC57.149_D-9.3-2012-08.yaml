abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to the measurement of Frequency Response Analysis
    (FRA) of oil immersed power transformers. It is intended to provide the user with
    the requirements and specifications for instrumentation, procedures for performing
    the tests, techniques for analyzing the data, and recommendations for long-term
    storage of the data and results.
