abstract:
- content: This list of standard laser-maser terms had its inception in the work of
    Subcommittee 28.7 of the IEEE Standards Committee. For various reasons work on
    these standards was suspended for a time. In 1970, with agreement of the Groups
    on Electron Devices and Microwave Theory and Techniques, work resumed under the
    aegis of the IEEE Council on Quantum Electronics. For convenience, terms from
    ANSI 2136.1-1973, American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers, have
    been inserted in this list where appropriate.
