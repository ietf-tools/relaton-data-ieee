abstract:
- content: This Standard specifies an architecture for a low mobility and energy efficient
    network for affordable broadband access. This network is referred to as the Frugal
    5G network. The network comprises of a wireless middle-mile network, an access
    network and the associated control and management functions. The standard also
    specifies the major interfaces in the Frugal 5G network.
