abstract:
- content: The monitoring of electrical characteristics of single-phase and polyphase
    ac power systems is encompassed in this recommended practice. It includes consistent
    descriptions of conducted electromagnetic phenomena occurring on power systems.
    This recommended practice describes nominal conditions and deviations from these
    nominal conditions that may originate within the source of supply or load equipment
    or may originate from interactions between the source and the load. Also, this
    recommended practice discusses power quality monitoring devices, application techniques,
    and the interpretation of monitoring results.
