abstract:
- content: This guide provides techniques for designers and facility operators to
    apply in determining the arc-flash hazard distance and the incident energy to
    which employees could be exposed during their work on or near electricalequipment.
    The changes to Clause 4 are to make use of the knowledge and experience of those
    who have performed studies as a guide in applying the standard.
