abstract:
- content: This standard provides multi-source and "plug and play" environment for
    the millions of metering devices in the field now and the future using the ANSI
    Type optical port interface. It solves the problems associated with single source
    systems and with multi-source systems based upon proprietary communications protocols.
    Electric, Water, and Gas Utilities and corresponding vendors can realize cost
    savings which ultimately shall benefit the client consumers of the Utilities.
