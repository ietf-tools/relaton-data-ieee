abstract:
- content: 'Pulse transformers for use in electronic equipment are considered. This
    standard applies to the following transformer types: power output (drivers), impedance
    matching, interstage coupling, current sensing, and blocking-oscillator transformers.
    For these transformers, the peak power transmitted ranges from a few milliwatts
    to many kilowatts, and the peak voltage transmitted ranges from a few volts to
    many kilovolts. Symbols, performance tests, equivalent circuits, preferred test
    methods, marking, and service conditions are covered.'
