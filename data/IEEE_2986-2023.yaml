abstract:
- content: 'Privacy and security issues pose great challenges to the federated machine
    leaning (FML) community. A general view on privacy and security risks while meeting
    applicable privacy and security requirements in FML is provided. This recommended
    practice is provided in four parts: malicious failure and non-malicious failure
    in FML, privacy and security requirements from the perspective of system and FML
    participants, defensive methods and fault recovery methods, and the privacy and
    security risks evaluation. It also provides some guidance for typical FML scenarios
    in different industry areas, which can facilitate practitioners to use FML in
    a better way.'
