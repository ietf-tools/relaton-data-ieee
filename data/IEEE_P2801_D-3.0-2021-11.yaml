abstract:
- content: The recommended practice promotes quality management activities for datasets
    used for artificial intelligence medical device(AIMD). The document highlights
    quality objective for dataset responsible organizations. The document describes
    control of records during the life cycle of datasets, including but not limited
    to data collection, annotation, transfer, utilization, storage, maintenance, update,
    retirement and other activities. The document emphasizes special consideration
    for the dataset quality management system, including but not limited to responsibility
    management, resource management, dataset realization and quality control.
