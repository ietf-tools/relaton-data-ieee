abstract:
- content: This newly developed guide compiles information on the application considerations
    ofprotective relays to ac transmission lines. The guide describes accepted transmission
    lineprotection schemes and the different electrical system parameters and situations
    that affect theirapplication. Its purpose is to provide a reference for the selection
    of relay schemes and to assistless experienced protective relaying engineers in
    their application.
