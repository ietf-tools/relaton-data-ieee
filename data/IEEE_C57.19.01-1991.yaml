abstract:
- content: Superseded by C57.19.01-2000 Electrical, dimensional, and related requirements
    for outdoor power-class apparatus bushings that have basic impulse insulation
    levels of 110 kV and higher are covered. Specific values for dimensional and related
    requirements that are to be interpreted, measured, or tested in accordance with
    IEEE C57.19.00-1991 are provided. Bushings covered by this standard are intended
    for use as components of oil-filled transformers, oil-filled reactors, and oil
    circuit breakers
