abstract:
- content: This Test Procedure covers instructions for conducting and reporting the
    more generally applicable and acceptable tests to determine the performance characteristics
    of direct-current tachometer generators. Direct-current tachometer generators
    are used for a variety of indicating and control purposes and a characteristic
    of primary importance in one application may be of little or no importance in
    another. This Procedure shall not be interpreted or construed as requiring the
    making of all or any of the tests herein in any given transaction. It is recognized
    that there may be methods other than those described herein. When more than one
    method is available, local conditions and the degree of precision desired will
    determine the method to be used. It is also recognized that tests under or after
    exposure to unusual environmental conditions are important in some applications
    but the diversity of these requirements is such that it is not practical to include
    them at this time.
