abstract:
- content: Significant aspects of handling SF<sub>6</sub> gas used in electric power
    equipment such as gas recovery, reclamation, recycling in order to keep the gas
    permanently in a closed cycle and avoiding any deliberate release in environment
    are described. The purpose of this guide is to provide state-of-the-art technologies
    and procedures to minimize SF<sub>6</sub> gas emission to a minimum functional
    level for the electric power equipment to preserve the environment. This guide
    will include all the aspects for consideration during commissioning and recommissioning,
    topping up, refilling, checking the gas quality at site, sampling and shipment
    for off-site gas analysis, and recovering and reclaiming during normal operation
    and at the end of the life of power equipment while dismantling. This guide also
    presents the state-of-the art tools and measuring devices including the necessary
    personnel protective equipment. The basis for the preparation of this guide is
    CIGRE Brochure No. 276, Guide for preparation of customized "Practical SF<sub>6</sub>
    handling instructions," August 2005 edition, developed by the Study Committee
    B3, Task Force B3.02.01.
