abstract:
- content: 'The 2017 NESC &#174; Handbook, Eight Edition, a Discussion of the National
    Electrical Safety Code(R), is an essential companion to the Code. This handbook
    includes text directly from Code which provides users an easy reference back to
    the code, ruling-by-ruling. It gives users insight into what lies behind the NESC(R)s
    rules and how to apply them. The Handbook was developed for use at many levels
    in the electric and communication industries, including those involved in system
    design, construction, maintenance, inspection, standards development and worker
    training. The Handbook also discusses how the NESC Committee has developed the
    rules in the Code and responded to change proposals during the past 100 years.
    This allows users to understand how questions they may have were dealt with in
    the past. These are key points from the 2017 Handbook Edition: - Revising the
    purpose rule to include only the safeguarding of persons and utility facilities
    and clarifying the application - Deleting unused definitions and adding definitions
    for communication and supply space. - Revising the substation impenetrable fence
    requirements. - Adding an exception to exempt underground cable grounding requirements
    from the 4 grounds in each mile rule under certain conditions. - Revising and
    reorganizing the guy insulator placement rules along with eliminating the voltage
    transfer requirements associated with them. - Requiring a 40” vertical clearance
    from communication cables in the communication space if a luminaire is not effectively
    grounded. - Deleting the conductance requirement for underground insulating jacketed
    grounded neutral supply cables and revising the grounding and bonding rules for
    supply and communication cables in random separation installations. - Revising
    and reorganizing the Grades of Construction Table 242-1 that will now include
    service drops. - Revising the strength rules to require that all conductors be
    considered for damage due to Aeolian vibration. - Revising the rules in Part 4
    to align with changes made to 29 CFR by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    (OSHA).'
