abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 60079 specifies general and testing requirements for electrical
    resistance trace heaters for application in explosive gas atmospheres. The standard
    covers trace heaters that may comprise either factory- or field- (work-site) assembled
    units, and which may be series heating cables, parallel heating cables or heating
    pads and heating panels that have been assembled and/or terminated in accordance
    with the manufacturer’s instructions. This standard also includes requirements
    for termination assemblies and control methods used with trace heating. The hazardous
    areas referred to by this standard are those defined in IEC 60079-10. Where a
    requirement of this standard conflicts with a requirement of IEC 60079-0, the
    requirement of this standard shall take precedence.
