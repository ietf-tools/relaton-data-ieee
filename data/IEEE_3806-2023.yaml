abstract:
- content: Liver and gallbladder diseases affect more than one billion people around
    the world, but there is still a lack of successful experience and models in terms
    of data standardization, integration, and sharing. The goal of this document is
    to solve the above problems through blockchain-based data circulation standards.
    This standard mainly describes the format of the data circulation and the application
    process of hepatobiliary diseases, which standardize the data collection, processing,
    and exchange process of hepatobiliary disease data in the medical information
    system, aiming to bring a new data credible circulation innovation model for medical
    education, data sharing applications, and medical artificial intelligence product
    research and development of hepatobiliary disease big data.
