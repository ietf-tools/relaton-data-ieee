abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 323-1974, Standard for Qualifying Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear
    Power Generating Stations, was developed to provide guidance for demonstrating
    and documenting the adequacy of electrical equipment used in all Class 1E and
    interface systems. This standard, IEEE Std 535-1979, was developed to provide
    specific methods and type test procedures for lead storage batteries in adherence
    to IEEE Std 323-1974. Adherence to this standard may not suffice for assuring
    public health and safety because it is the integrated performance of the electrical
    systems of the station that limits the consequence of accidents. Each applicant
    has the responsibility to assure himself and others that this document, if used,
    is pertinent to his application and that the integrated performance of his station
    is adequate. This document describes qualification methods for Class 1E lead storage
    batteries and racks to be used in nuclear power generating stations outside of
    primary containment. Qualification required in ANSI/IEEE Std 279-1971 and IEEE
    Std 308-1978, can be demonstrated by using the procedures provided in this standard
    in accordance with IEEE Std 323-1974. Battery sizing, maintenance, capacity testing,
    installation, charging equipment and consideration of other type batteries are
    beyond the scope of this standard.
