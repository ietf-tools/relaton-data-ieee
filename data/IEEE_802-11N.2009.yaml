abstract:
- content: This amendment defines modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 physical layer
    (PHY) and the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) sublayer so that modes of
    operation can be enabled that are capable of much higher throughputs, with a maximum
    throughput of at least 100 Mb/s, as measured at the MAC data service access point
    (SAP).
