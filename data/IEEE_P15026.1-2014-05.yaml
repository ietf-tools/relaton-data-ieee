abstract:
- content: This part of ISO/IEC defines assurance-related terms and establishes an
    organized set of concepts and relationships to establish a basis for shared understanding
    across user communities for assurance. It provides information to users of the
    other parts of this International Standard including the combined use of multiple
    parts. The essential concept introduced by ISO/IEC 15026 is the statement of claims
    in an assurance case and the support of those claims through argumentation and
    evidence. These claims are in the context of assurance for properties of systems
    and software within life cycle processes for the system or software product.Assurance
    for a service being operated and managed on an ongoing basis is not covered in
    ISO/IEC 15026.
