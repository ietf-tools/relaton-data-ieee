abstract:
- content: Recommended methods and standardized reporting practices for electrical
    characterization of printed and organic transistors are covered. Due to the nature
    of printed and organic electronics, significant measurement errors can be introduced
    if the electrical characterization design-of-experiment is not properly addressed.
    This standard describes the most common sources of measurement error, particularly
    for high-impedance electrical measurements commonly required for printed and organic
    transistors. This standard also gives recommended practices in order to minimize
    and/or characterize the effect of measurement artifacts and other sources of error
    encountered while measuring printed and organic transistors.
