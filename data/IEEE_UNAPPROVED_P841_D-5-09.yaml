abstract:
- content: This standard applies to premium efficiency totally enclosed fan-cooled
    (TEFC), horizontal and vertical, single-speed, squirrel cage polyphase induction
    motors, up to and including 370 kW (500 hp), and 4000 volts in National Electrical
    Manufacturers Association (NEMA) frame sizes 143T and larger, for petroleum, chemical,
    and other severe duty applications (commonly referred to as premium efficiency
    severe duty motors). Excluded from the scope of this standard are motors with
    sleeve bearings and additional specific features required for explosion-proof
    motors.
