abstract:
- content: A test procedure for comparing expected life, at rated temperature, of
    two or more sealed insulation systems is outlined. The procedure is limited to
    insulation systems for ac electric machines using random-wound stator coils. It
    is the intent of this procedure to evaluate insulation systems for use with air
    cooling under severe environmental conditions where the insulation is exposed
    to conducting contaminants. It does not cover special requirements such as those
    for machines enclosed in gas atmospheres, subjected to strong chemicals, or to
    submersion in liquids.
