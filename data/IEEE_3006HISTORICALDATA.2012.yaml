abstract:
- content: Reliability data gathered from equipment reliability surveys and analyses
    over a period of 35 years or more is summarized in this collection. Equipment
    surveys conducted prior to 1976, detailed reports on the surveys and data collection
    efforts, and extensive lists of references on equipment reliability are presented.
    The collection provides the analyst with options for determining reliability parameters
    for older electrical systems.

- content: An IEEE sponsored survey of Electrical Equipment reliability in industrial
    plants was completed during 1972. The results are reported from this survey which
    included a total of 1982 equipment failures that were reported by 30 companies
    covering 68 plants in nine industries in the United States and Canada.
