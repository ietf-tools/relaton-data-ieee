abstract:
- content: This standard on piezoelectricity contains many equations based upon the
    analysis of vibrations in piezoelectric materials having simple geometrical shapes.
    Mechanical and electrical dissipation are never introduced into the theoretical
    treatment, and except for a brief discussion of nonlinear effects, all the results
    are based on linear piezoelectricity in which the elastic, piezoelectric, and
    dielectric coefficients are treated as constants independent of the magnitude
    and frequency of applied mechanical stresses and electric fields.<<ETX>>
