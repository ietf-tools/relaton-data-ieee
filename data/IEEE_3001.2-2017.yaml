abstract:
- content: Commercial, institutional, and industrial design of electrical services,
    interconnecting with a utility distribution or transmission system is explored.
    The electrical system information needed by the designer concerning the utility
    s system characteristics, and the electrical load information needed by the utility
    to design a satisfactory electrical interface between the serving utility and
    the premise electrical distribution system is considered.
