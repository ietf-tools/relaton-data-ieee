abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of the mechanical operations test for high-voltage air switches
    is to demonstrate the ability of a completely assembled switch to operate satisfactorily
    during its operating life expectancy. The test code has been patterned after IEC
    Publication 129, Specifications for Alternating Current Disconnectors (Isolators)
    and Earthing Switches, paragraph 48. The following specific comments noted are
    to assist in the evaluation of each section of the supplement stated below: 4.3
    It is necessary to motor operate at minimum and maxium control voltage (as in
    IEC Publication 129) because operation at other than rated control voltage may
    produce significantly different forces and stresses from those produced during
    norma! voltage operatian. 4.4 IEC Publication 129 allows lubrication during the
    test, These proposed revisions do not. 5.3 Final judgment for acceptable completion
    of the mechanical nperations test (if there is any concern about contact pressure
    loss, voltage drop increase, or resistance increase through mechanical wear) requires
    satisfactory completion of a temperature rise or short-time current test.'
