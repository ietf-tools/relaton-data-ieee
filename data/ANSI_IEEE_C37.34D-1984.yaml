abstract:
- content: Included in C37.34-1971 (R1992) . Procedures for corona testing of non-enclosed
    and enclosed switches with a rated maximum voltage of 121 kV and above are established.
    Test requirements and conditions are specified, and a test procedure is given.
    Simultaneous corona and radio-influence testing is addressed.(Supplement to ANSI/IEEE
    C37.34-1971)
