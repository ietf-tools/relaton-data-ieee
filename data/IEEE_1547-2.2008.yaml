abstract:
- content: In this paper, technical background and application details to support
    understanding of IEEE Std 1547-2003 are provided. The guide facilitates the use
    of IEEE Std 1547-2003 by characterizing various forms of distributed resource
    (DR) technologies and their associated interconnection issues. It provides background
    and rationale of the technical requirements of IEEE Std 1547-2003. It also provides
    tips, techniques, and rules of thumb, and it addresses topics related to DR project
    implementation to enhance the user's understanding of how IEEE Std 1547-2003 may
    relate to those topics. This guide is intended for use by engineers, engineering
    consultants, and knowledgeable individuals in the field of DR. The IEEE 1547 series
    of standards is cited in the Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, and this guide
    is one document in the IEEE 1547 series.
