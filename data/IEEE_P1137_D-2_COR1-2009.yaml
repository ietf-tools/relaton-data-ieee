abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1137-1991 provides guidance for controlling or modifying the inductive
    environment and the susceptibility of affected wire line telecommunications facilities
    in order to operate within the acceptable levels of steady-state or surge induced
    voltages of the environmental interface (probe wire) defined by IEEE Std 776-1987.
    Procedures for determining the source of the problem are given. Mitigation theory
    and philosophy are discussed, and mitigation devices are described. The application
    of typical mitigation apparatus is addressed. Advice for determining the best
    engineering solution is offered, and general safety considerations are discussed.
    This corrigendum corrects Table 3&#8212;Longitudinal Balance Performance Thresholds
    and the first and last sentences of the third paragraph in 8.5 of IEEE Std 1137-1991.
