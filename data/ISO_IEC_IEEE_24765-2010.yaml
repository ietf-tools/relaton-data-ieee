abstract:
- content: The systems and software engineering disciplines are continuing to mature
    while information technology advances. This International Standard was prepared
    to collect and standardize terminology. Its purpose is to identify terms currently
    in use in the field and standard definitions for these terms. It is intended to
    serve as a useful reference for those in the Information Technology field, and
    to encourage the use of systems and software engineering standards prepared by
    ISO and liaison organizations IEEE Computer Society and Project Management Institute
    (PMI). This International Standard replaces IEEE Std 610.12-1990, IEEE Standard
    Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, which was contributed by the IEEE
    as a source document. The approach and lexical exactitude of IEEE Std 610.12-1990
    served as a model for this International Standard. Nevertheless, approximately
    two thirds of the definitions in this International Standard are new since IEEE
    Std 610.12 was last updated in 1990, a reflection of the continued evolution in
    the field.
