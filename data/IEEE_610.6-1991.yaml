abstract:
- content: Terms in the field of computer graphics are defined. Topics covered include
    general computer graphics concepts, computer graphics hardware and hardware concepts,
    primitives and attributes, input devices, image concepts and techniques, display
    techniques, visual effects, windows and viewports, CRT terminology, and three-dimensional
    technology. Terms considered to be parochial to one group or organisation, company
    proprietary or trademarked, multiword terms whose meaning could be inferred from
    the definitions of the component words, and terms whose meaning in the computer
    field could be directly inferred from their standard English meaning are excluded.<<ETX>>
