abstract:
- content: Direction for the design and installation of safety-related electrical
    cable systems, including associated circuits, in nuclear power generating stations
    is provided. Existing standards are identified and guidance is provided for the
    design and installation of those non-safety-related cable systems that may affect
    the function of safety-related systems. Solutions are recommended for areas of
    concern such as fire protection, raceways, separation, cable performance requirements,
    and installation acceptance testing and documentation.
