abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1109-1990, IEEE Guide for the Interconnection of User-Owned Substations
    to ElectricUtilities, provides a checklist and selected guidance, for persons
    not normally practicing in this specialized field, of major technical design areas
    that should be considered when interconnecting user-owned and utility-owned facilities
    at substations. Only medium- and high-voltage purchased-power interconnections
    are addressed. This guide does not discuss the considerable implications of interactive
    power systems design and operation, nor does it present criteria or directions
    for the design of substations.
