abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 741-2007. This standard prescribes criteria that
    establish protection requirements for Class 1E power systems and equipment. It
    describes the purpose of and the means for obtaining protection from electrical
    and mechanical damage, or failures that can occur within a time period that is
    shorter than that required for operator action. It includes testing and surveillance
    requirements. It does not include plant physical design requirements to protect
    against events such as pipe whip, fire, dropped load, etc.
