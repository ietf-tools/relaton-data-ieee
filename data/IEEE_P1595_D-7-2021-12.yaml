abstract:
- content: Optical phase conductor (OPPC) is a phase conductor with optical fibers
    for telecommunication purposes. This standard covers the performance, test requirements,
    procedures, and acceptance criteria for an OPPC. Functional requirements, such
    as electrical, mechanical, optical fiber, environmental, and packaging, and test
    requirements related to design, 4 installation, in-service, and maintenance, including
    routine tests, are covered.
