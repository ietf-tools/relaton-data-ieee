abstract:
- content: The performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria
    for an OPPC are covered in this standard. Optical phase conductor (OPPC) is a
    phase conductor with optical fibers for telecommunication purposes. Functional
    requirements, such as electrical, mechanical, optical fiber, environmental, and
    packaging, and test requirements related to design, installation, in-service,
    and maintenance, including routine tests, are also covered.
