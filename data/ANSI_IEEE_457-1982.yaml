abstract:
- content: This standard presents definitions of terms for non-linear, active, and
    non-reciprocal waveguide components. It is a companion to two other published
    standards, Definitions of Fundamental Waveguide Terms, IEEE Std 146-1980 and Definitions
    of Terms for Waveguide Components, IEEE Std 147-1979. The latter covers linear
    and passive waveguide components.
