abstract:
- content: 'The reporting and statistical analysis of reliability of power transformers
    and shunt reactors used on electric utility power systems are addressed. The following
    types and applications of transformers are covered: power transformers, autotransformers,
    regulating transformers, phase-shifting transformers, shunt reactors, HVDC converter
    transformers, substation transformers, transmission tie transformers, unit transformers,
    unit auxiliary transformers, and grounding transformers. The format for the collection
    and reporting of data is presented, and the kinds of reports that may be useful
    to both users and manufacturers of transformers are illustrated. (This standard
    has been superseded by IEEE C57.125-2015)'
