abstract:
- content: This standard describes the independence requirements of the circuits and
    equipment comprising or associated with Class 1E systems, including those required
    for safe shutdown. It sets forth criteria for the independence that can be achieved
    by physical separation and electrical isolation of circuits and equipment which
    are redundant but does not address the determination of what is to be considered
    redundant.
