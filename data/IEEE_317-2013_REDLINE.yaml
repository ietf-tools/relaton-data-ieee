abstract:
- content: An electric penetration assembly is an assembly of insulated electric conductors,
    conductor seals, module seals (if any), and aperture seals that provides the passage
    of the electric conductors through a single aperture in the nuclear containment
    structure, while providing a pressure barrier between the inside and the outside
    of the containment structure. The electric penetration assembly includes terminal
    (junction) boxes, terminal blocks, connectors and cable supports, and splices
    which are designed and furnished as an integral part of the assembly. Requirements
    for the design, construction, qualification, test, and installation of electric
    penetration assemblies in nuclear containment structures for stationary nuclear
    power generating stations are prescribed in this standard.
