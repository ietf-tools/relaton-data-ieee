abstract:
- content: The media access control characteristics for the Demand Priority access
    method are specified. The layer management, physical layers, and media that support
    this access method are also specified. Layer and sublayer interface specifications
    are aligned to the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model and
    ISO/IEC 8802 models. Specifications for 100 Mb/s operation over 100 = balanced
    cable (twisted-pair) category 3 through 5, 150 = shielded balanced cable, and
    fibre optic media are included.
