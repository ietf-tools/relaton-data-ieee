abstract:
- content: SystemC<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> is defined in this standard. SystemC is an ANSI
    standard C++ class library for system and hardware design for use by designers
    and architects who need to address complex systems that are a hybrid between hardware
    and software. This standard provides a precise and complete definition of the
    SystemC class library so that a SystemC implementation can be developed with reference
    to this standard alone. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementors
    of the SystemC class library, the implementors of tools supporting the class library,
    and the users of the class library.
