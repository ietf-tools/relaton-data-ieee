abstract:
- content: Difficulties that may be encountered, and how they can be avoided, by organizations
    intending to adopt CASE tools are addressed. An overview of the adoption process,
    including analysis of the organization's needs and readiness for automation, use
    of a pilot project, and definition of activities necessary to integrate the new
    technology into the organization's standard software engineering practice, is
    provided.
