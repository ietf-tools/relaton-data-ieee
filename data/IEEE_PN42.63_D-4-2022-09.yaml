abstract:
- content: This standard establishes performance criteria and characterization techniques
    for radiation measurement systems incorporated onto unmanned aerial systems. This
    standard focuses on radiation response expectations and environmental parameters
    that could be experienced during use such as temperature changes, mechanical shock,
    and onboard vibration. For radiation response expectations, response vectors include
    those expected from distributed radioactive contamination and from radioactive
    point sources. The primary UAVs of interest include those from Group 1 and Group
    2 UAV designations
