abstract:
- content: 'This standard describes control mechanisms and management methods necessary
    to enable creation and operation of virtual links in Ethernet-based subscriber
    access networks. The key characteristics of the Virtual Link Control (VLC) mechanisms
    are: -The ability to transit Layer 2 bridges in a single IEEE 802 Media Access
    Control (MAC) domain to allow remote device management; -Extensibility to accommodate
    new protocols and new types of devices; -The ability to simultaneously send messages
    to multiple VLC-aware stations using broadcast or multicast addressing. The standard
    describes the message format, as well as processing operations at the stations
    participating in the VLC protocol.'
