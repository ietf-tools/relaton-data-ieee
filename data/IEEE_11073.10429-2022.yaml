abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, in this standard, a normative definition of the communication between
    personal telehealth spirometry devices and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal
    computers, personal health appliances, set-top boxes) is established in a manner
    that enables plug-and-play interoperability. Appropriate portions of existing
    standards are leveraged, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models,
    application profile standards, and transport standards. The use of specific term
    codes, formats, and behaviors are specified in telehealth environments restricting
    optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. A common core of
    communication functionality for personal telehealth spirometry is defined in this
    standard.
