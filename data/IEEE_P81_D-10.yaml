abstract:
- content: Practical test methods and techniques are presented for measuring the electrical
    characteristics of grounding systems. Topics addressed include safety considerations;
    measuring earth resistivity; measuring the power system frequency resistance or
    impedance of the ground system to remote earth; measuring the transient or surge
    impedance of the ground system to remote earth; measuring step and touch voltages;
    verifying the integrity of the grounding system; reviewing common methods for
    performing ground testing; reviewing instrumentation characteristics and limitations;
    and reviewing various factors that can distort test measurements.
