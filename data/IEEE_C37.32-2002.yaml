abstract:
- content: This standard provides the schedules of preferred ratings and construction
    specifications for high-voltage disconnect, interrupter, fault initiating, and
    grounding switches rated above 1000 volts. Switch operator control voltage ranges
    (formerly C37.33), bus supports and accessories are also covered by this standard.
    Switches included in C37.20.2, C37.20.3, C37.20.4, C37.71, C37.72 and C37.73 are
    not covered by this standard. (Superseded by C37.30.1-2011)
