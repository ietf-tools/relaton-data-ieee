abstract:
- content: This standard provides specifications for representing three-dimensional
    (30) maps for robotics and automation. This standard defines a recommended format
    for exchanging map data among robots, computers, and other devices. The representation
    format specified by this standard considers static maps and describes their elements
    and associated uncertainty independently of the geographic scale and sensor modalities
    used to build the maps. In particular, this standard (a) defines a hierarchy of
    terminologies related to 30 robot maps for robotics and automation; (b) specifies
    a data model for each element of the hierarchy; and (c) specifies a JSON format
    for map data exchange between different robots, computer systems, and devices.
    This standard provides formats for exchanging 30 map data between robots and devices
    (e.g., by transmitting them over a communication channel or by saving them on
    some storing devices). This standard is not intended to affect internal formats
    that robots and devices use to build, update, and use maps.
