abstract:
- content: Specification and test requirements for a single-axis Coriolis vibratory
    gyro (CVG) for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement
    measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. A standard
    specification format guide for the preparation of a single-axis CVG is provided.
    A compilation of recommended procedures for testing a CVG, derived from those
    presently used in the industry, is also provided. Informative annexes cover CVG
    design features and theoretical principles of operation.
