abstract:
- content: Methods for performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00 and other
    standards applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers
    are described. Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators,
    arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding
    transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. This standard covers resistance
    measurements, polarity and phase-relation tests, ratio tests, no-load loss and
    excitation current measurements, impedance and load loss measurements, dielectric
    tests, temperature tests, short-circuit tests, audible sound level measurements,
    and calculated data.
