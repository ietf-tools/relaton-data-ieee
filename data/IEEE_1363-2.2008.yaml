abstract:
- content: This standard covers specifications of public-key cryptographic techniques
    for password-based authentication and key establishment, supplemental to the techniques
    described in IEEE Std 1363trade-2000 and IEEE Std 1363atrade-2004. It is intended
    as a companion standard to IEEE Std 1363-2000 and IEEE Std 1363a-2004. It includes
    specifications of primitives and schemes designed to utilize passwords and other
    low-grade secrets as a basis for securing electronic transactions, including schemes
    for password-authenticated key agreement and password-authenticated key retrieval.
