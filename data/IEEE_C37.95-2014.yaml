abstract:
- content: Described in this guide are protective relay applications involving electric
    service to consumers that requires a transformation between the utility’s supply
    voltage and the consumer’s utilization voltage. It describes the factors that
    need to be considered in the design of adequate protection facilities, outlines
    modern relay practices, and provides several examples of the protection of typical
    utility-consumer interconnections.
