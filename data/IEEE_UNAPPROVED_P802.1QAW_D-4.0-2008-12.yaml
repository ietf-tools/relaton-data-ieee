abstract:
- content: This amendment extends the connectivity fault management capabilities introduced
    in IEEE Std 802.1ag-2007 to include tools to facilitate diagnosis and isolation
    of faults sensitive to, or caused by, particular data patterns in frames transmitted
    by a service user. See the introductory notes for what this draft tries to accomplish,
    and for project scope, status, and history.
