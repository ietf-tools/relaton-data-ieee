abstract:
- content: 'The operational and performance requirements for backpack-based radiation-detection
    systems (BRDs) used in homeland security applications are specified in this standard.
    BRDs are typically worn by the user during operations to detect and possibly identify
    radiological and nuclear material. NOTE: The PDF of this standard is available
    at no cost compliments of the partnership with the Department of Homeland Security
    Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and the IEEE GET Program https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=83)'
