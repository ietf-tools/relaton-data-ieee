abstract:
- content: ISO/IEEE Dual logo This standard establishes a connection-oriented transport
    profile and physical layer suitable for medical device communications that use
    short-range infrared wireless. This standard defines communications services and
    protocols consistent with specifications of the Infrared Data Association, and
    are optimized for point-of-care applications at or near the patient.
