abstract:
- content: 'The objective of this document is to provide procedures for measuring
    the human exposure from devices intended to be used at a position near the human
    head or body. It was developed to provide procedures to evaluate electromagnetic
    field (EMF) exposures due to radio frequency (RF) transmitting devices used next
    to the ear, in front of the face, mounted on the body, operating in conjunction
    with other RF-transmitting and non -transmitting devices or accessories (e.g.
    belt -clips), or embedded in garments. The types of devices dealt with include
    but are not limited to mobile telephones, cordless telephones, cordless microphones,
    and radio transmitters in personal computers. The applicable frequency range is
    from 4 MHz to 10 GHz. The document defines: - measurement system requirements
    (Clause 6), - SAR measurement protocols (Clause 7), - SAR measurement uncertainty
    evaluation (Clause 8), and - reporting requirements (Clause 9). At the time this
    document was developed, two computational and measurement joint I EC/IEEE projects
    dealing with millimetre -wave power density assessment were under development,
    covering the frequency range from 6 GHz to 300 GHz. Hence there is an overlap
    of frequency between this document, which deals with SAR, and the other joint
    IEC/IEEE projects dealing with power density from 6 GHz to 10 GHz. The IEC/IEEE
    joint working group was aware of this fact and believed that it would give the
    flexibility of using whatever metrics suitable for the considered case of compliance
    assessment.'
