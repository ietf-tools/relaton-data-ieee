abstract:
- content: Coaxial Connectors for precision electrical measurements to 110 GHz. The
    frequency range of the standard is increased from 65 GHz to 110 GHz since there
    exists in the market a 1mm coaxial connector with a rated upper minimum operating
    frequency of 110 GHz. The members of the subcommittee felt in view of this, the
    scope of the project should be changed to incorporate this advantage.
