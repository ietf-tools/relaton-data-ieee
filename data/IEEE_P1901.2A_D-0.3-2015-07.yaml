abstract:
- content: An amendment to the IEEE Std 1901.2-2013&#8482; standard for narrowband
    power line communications (PLC) via alternating current, direct current, and nonenergized
    electric power lines using frequencies below 500 kHz. The scope of the amendments
    include changes to clarify how and when to encrypt header and payload information
    elements, update the interleaver design in order to eliminate some drawbacks in
    certain channels, a new PHY data primitive attribute so sub-band SNR data can
    be obtained from the PHY, modification to the frame counter size for security
    to make it consistent with IEEE Std 802.15.4e&#8482;-2012, and adding a beacon
    attribute and change the zero crossing detector text.
