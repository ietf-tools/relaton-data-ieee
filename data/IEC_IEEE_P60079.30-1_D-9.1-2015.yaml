abstract:
- content: IEC/IEEE 60079-30-1 is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of
    the essentialrequirements and testing appropriate to electric surface heating
    equipment used in explosiveatmospheres. The requirements of this part of IEC 60079
    are considered to be the minimumrequirements for equipment protection levels Gb,
    Gc, Db, and Dc in explosive atmospheresfor gases, dusts, and fibres/flyings. While
    some of this work already exists in nationalstandards or international standards,
    this standard has collated much of this existing work andconsiderably added to
    it. This standard also contains the minimum requirements for usersapplying the
    Division method of area classification.
