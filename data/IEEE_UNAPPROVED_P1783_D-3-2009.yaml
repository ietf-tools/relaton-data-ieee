abstract:
- content: IEEE-DEIS and PES Task Forces on insulator icing have been refining test
    methods for freezing conditions, including ice and snow, since 1999. This guide
    consolidates the discussion and recommends specific, appropriate and reproducible
    test methods for selecting adequate insulators. The scope includes test methods
    for substation and line insulators at distribution and transmission voltage levels.
    The test methods detail special measures to reproduce the environmental and insulator
    parameters that influence the risk of flashover in freezing conditions. Statistical
    methods are also recommended to assist in the insulator selection process.
