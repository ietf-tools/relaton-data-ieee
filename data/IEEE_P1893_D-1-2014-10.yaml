abstract:
- content: In this guide, field testing methodology and techniques are presented for
    measuring DC transmission line and earth electrode line parameters. The topics
    to be addressed will include basic requirements of the measurement; safety cautions;
    requirements for test instruments; testing induced voltage and current; verifying
    the polarity and testing insulation resistance; measuring DC resistance; measuring
    impedance frequency characteristic; reviewing various factors that can distort
    measurements.
