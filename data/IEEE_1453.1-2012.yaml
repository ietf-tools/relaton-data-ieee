abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 61000-3-7:2008 is adopted by this guide. IEC 61000-3-7:2008 provides
    guidance on the principles that can be used as the basis for determining the requirements
    for the connection of fluctuating installations to MV, HV, and EHV power systems
    (LV installations are covered in other IEC documents). The primary objective of
    this guide is to provide guidance to system operators or owners on engineering
    practices that will facilitate adequate service quality for all connected customers.
    This guide provides a methodology to allocate the capacity of the system to absorb
    voltage fluctuations (i.e., flicker). However, it does not address how to mitigate
    voltage fluctuations, nor does it address how to increase the capacity of the
    system to absorb such disturbances. Since the procedures outlined in this guide
    are necessarily based on certain simplifying assumptions, the approach will not
    always provide an optimum solution. The recommended approach should be used with
    flexibility and engineering judgment, when applying the given assessment procedures
    in full or in part.
