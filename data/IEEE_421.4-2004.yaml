abstract:
- content: This guide is intended to provide to the specification writer the information
    to prepare a specification for the purchase of an excitation system. This guide
    is presented in narrative form with descriptions of functions typical of excitation
    systems. Narrative is provided describing types of excitation systems and information
    required for sizing the excitation system.
