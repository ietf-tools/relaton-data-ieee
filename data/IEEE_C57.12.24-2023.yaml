abstract:
- content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered
    in this standard. Certain safety features of three-phase, 60-Hz, liquid-immersed,
    self-cooled, submersible transformers with separable insulated high-voltage connectors
    are also taken into consideration These transformers are rated 3750 kVA and smaller
    with high voltages of 34 500 GrdY/19 920 V and below and with low voltages of
    600 V and below.
