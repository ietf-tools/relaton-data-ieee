abstract:
- content: This IEEE standards product is part C62 Family on Surge Protection and
    supersedes C62.41 The scope of this recommended practice is to characterize the
    surge environment at locations on ac power circuits described in IEEE Std C62.41.1-2002
    by means of standardized waveforms and other stress parameters. The surges considered
    in this recommended practice do not exceed one half-cycle of the normal mains
    waveform (fundamental frequency) in duration. They can be periodic or random events
    and can appear in any combination of line, neutral, or grounding conductors. They
    include surges with amplitudes, durations, or rates of change sufficient to cause
    equipment damage or operational upset. While surge protective devices (SPDs) acting
    primarily on the amplitude of the voltage or current are often applied to divert
    the damaging surges, the upsetting surges might require other remedies.
