abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of this guide is: 1) To review grounding practices with especial
    reference to safety. 2) To establish, as a basis for design, the safe limits for
    potential differences which can exist in a station, under fault conditions, between
    points which can be contacted by the human body. 3) To provide a step by step
    guide for the design of practical grounding systems based on these limits. 4)
    To recommend test methods for obtaining data for the design of ground systems,
    and for verifying the adequacy of ground systems as constructed. 5) To develop
    mathematical methods as an aid in the understanding and solution of typical ground
    gradient problems. 6) To make available in English translation, some of the more
    pertinent and valuable foreign language articles. 7) To provide a comprehensive
    bibliography, with abstracts, of existing literature related to the subject, for
    the benefit of those seeking additional information not included herein.'
