abstract:
- content: The present state of the technique of measuring ground resistance and impedance,
    earth resistivity, and potential gradients from currents in the earth, and the
    prediction of the magnitude of ground resistance and potential gradients from
    scale-model tests are described and discussed. Factors influencing the choice
    of instruments and the techniques for various types of measurements are covered.
    These include the purpose of the measurement, the accuracy required, the type
    of instruments available, possible sources of error, and the nature of the ground
    or grounding system under test. The intent is to assist the engineer or technician
    in obtaining and interpreting accurate, reliable data. The test procedures described
    promote the safety of personnel and property and prevent interference with the
    operation of neighboring facilities.
