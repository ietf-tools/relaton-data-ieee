abstract:
- content: The evaluation and handling procedures for natural ester transformer insulating
    fluids are covered. The guide¿s purpose is to assist the transformer operator
    in evaluating the serviceability of new, unused fluids being received by the equipment
    manufacturer or service company and fluid in new equipment. It also assists the
    operator in maintaining the fluids in serviceable condition.
