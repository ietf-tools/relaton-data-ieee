abstract:
- content: Electrical, dimensional, and mechanical charasteristics and certain safety
    features of single-phase, 60Hz, liquid-immersed, self cooled, submersible distribution
    transformers are covered. This standard is intended for use as a basis for establishing
    the performance, electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and safety of the
    equipment covered, and to assist in the proper selection of such equipment.
