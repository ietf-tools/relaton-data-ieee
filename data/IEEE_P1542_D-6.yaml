    for installation, maintenance and operation and of irrigation equipment near or
    under overhead power lines as they pertain to minimum distance to energized conductors
    and proper grounding to avoid nuisance shocks. The Guide covers a variety of conditions
    in general terms. Specific recommendations are made for the type of irrigation
    systems and power line parameters most commonly found.
