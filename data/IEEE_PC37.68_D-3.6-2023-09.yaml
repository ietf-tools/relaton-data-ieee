abstract:
- content: Basic requirements intended to mitigate the effects of the harsh environments
    encountered by microprocessor-based controls of distribution switchgear rated
    above 1 kV up to and including 38 kV are covered. Basic requirements include the
    design, testing and application of microprocessor-based controls. Microprocessor-based
    controls covered by IEEE Std C37.68 TM are intended to be applied in distribution
    switchgear which is normally mounted on power poles, in wet or dry vaults, or
    in pad-mounted switchgear enclosures.
