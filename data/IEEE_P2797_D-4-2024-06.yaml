abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to the prediction and early warning of icing on
    overhead transmission lines (OHLs) in micro-topographic areas, presenting criteria
    for identifying micro topographic areas and methods for predicting the icing thickness
    of OHLs. This guide aims to provide guidelines for the observation, monitoring,
    prediction, early warning, and melting of ice on OHLs in micro-topographic areas,
    serving as references for anti-icing design and maintenance of OHLs in icing prone
    areas.
