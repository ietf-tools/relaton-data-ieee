abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2004 The basic principles, requirements, and methods for qualifying
    Class 1E motor control centers for both harsh- and mild-environment applications
    in nuclear power generating stations are described. In addition to defining specific
    qualification requirements for Class 1E motor control centers and their components
    in accordance with the more general qualification requirements of IEEE Std 323-1983,
    this standard is intended to provide guidance in establishing a qualification
    program for demonstrating the adequacy of Class 1E motor control centers in nuclear
    power generating station applications.
