abstract:
  content: This guide applies to all types of static power converters used in industrial
    and commercial power systems. The problems involved in the harmonic control and
    reactive compensation of such converters are addressed, and an application guide
    is provided. Limits of disturbances to the ac power distribution system that affect
    other equipment and communications are recommended. This guide is not intended
    to cover the effect of radio frequency interference.
