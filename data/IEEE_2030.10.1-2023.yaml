abstract:
- content: Specifications are provided by this standard for direct current (dc)-based
    installations to address requirements given in Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the multi-tier
    framework (MTF). The MTF is discussed in detail in the Energy Sector Management
    Assistance Program (ESMAP) report published by the World Bank. Installation rules
    are provided by this standard, which is meant to be used in areas that are not
    connected to the ac public distribution network, for basic electricity supply
    from a renewable source. Use of a safety extra-low voltage (SELV) that can be
    safer to operate under normal, dry conditions is advocated by the standard. Circuit/branch
    current is limited to make it more difficult for an arc to propagate. Power access,
    which is possible without any special parts, is delivered by this approach. Wiring
    that is similar to that used in an ac system in a cost-effective and scalable
    manner can be used by the resultant installation.
