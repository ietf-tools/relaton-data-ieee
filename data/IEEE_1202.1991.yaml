abstract:
  content: Revised by IEEE Std 1202-2006 A test protocol and the performance criteria
    to determine the flame propagation tendency of cables in a vertical cable tray
    are established. It applies to single insulated and multiconductor cables. The
    test consists of exposing cable samples to a theoretical 20 kW (70 000 Btu/hr)
    flaming ignition source for a 20 min duration. The test facility, test sample
    requirements, test procedure, and evaluation of results are covered. A test protocol
