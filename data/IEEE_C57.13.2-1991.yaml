abstract:
- content: Conformance test requirements are provided for current and inductively-coupled
    voltage transformers used for measurement and control functions in unit substations
    at primary system voltages above 600 V, but not exceeding 38 kV, except for those
    in certain installations as set forth in the standard. The selection of transformers
    for conformance testing, the basis for conformance, and the treatment of failures
    within a test sequence are covered. Impulse, voltage-withstand, accuracy, and
    temperature rise are specified. Insulation systems acceptance and production monitoring
    are considered
