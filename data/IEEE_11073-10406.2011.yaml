abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of the communication between personal basic
    electrocardiograph (ECG) devices and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers,
    personal health appliances, and set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play
    interoperability is established in this standard. Appropriate portions of existing
    standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and IEEE 11073-20601 information
    models are leveraged. The use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in
    telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of
    interoperability is specified. A common core of communication functionality for
    personal telehealth basic ECG (1to 3-lead ECG) devices is defined. Monitoring
    ECG devices are distinguished from diagnostic ECG equipment with respect to including
    support for wearable ECG devices, limiting the number of leads supported by the
    equipment to three, and not requiring the capability of annotating or analyzing
    the detected electrical activity to determine known cardiac phenomena. This standard
    is consistent with the base framework and allows multifunction implementations
    by following multiple device specializations (e.g., ECG and respiration rate).
