abstract:
- content: A framework of scientific knowledge graphs is proposed in this guide. This
    guide divides the stakeholders of scientific knowledge graph into scientific data
    supplier, scientific knowledge graph technology supplier, scientific knowledge
    graph integrator, scientific knowledge graph user and scientific knowledge graph
    ecological partner. The main activities of data governance, construction, integration,
    application and ecological development of the stakeholders are described in detail.
