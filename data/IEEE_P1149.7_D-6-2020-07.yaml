abstract:
- content: This specification describes circuitry that may be added to an integrated
    circuit to provide access to on-chip Test Access Ports (TAPs) specified by IEEE
    Std 1149.1. The circuitry uses IEEE Std 1149.1 as its foundation, providing complete
    backward compatibility, while aggressively adding features to support test and
    applications debug. It defines six classes of 1149.7 Test Access Ports (TAP.7s),
    T0&#8211;T5, with each class providing incremental capability, building on that
    of the lower level classes. Class T0 provides the behavior specified by 1149.1
    from startup when there are multiple on-chip TAPs. Class T1 adds common debug
    functions and features to minimize power consumption. Class T2 adds operating
    modes that maximize scan performance. It also provides an optional hot-connection
    capability to prevent system corruption when a connection is made to a powered
    system. Class T3 supports operation in either a four-wire Series or Star Scan
    Topology. Class T4 provides for communication with either a two-pin or four-pin
    interface. The two-pin operation serializes 1149.1 transactions and provides for
    higher Test Clock rates. Class T5 adds the ability to perform data transfers concurrently
    with scan, supports utilization of functions other than scan, and provides control
    of TAP.7 pins to custom debug technologies in a manner that ensures current and
    future interoperability.
