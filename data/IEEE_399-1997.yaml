abstract:
- content: 'This IEEE Standards product is part of the Color Books family. Today’s
    intensely competitive business environment forces plant and building management
    to be very aware of the total owning cost of power distribution systems. Furthermore,
    these managers demand assurance of maximum return on capital investments in the
    power system. Power system studies are used to ensure that this maximum return
    is achieved, and the IEEE Brown Book is a valuable source of information about
    the purposes of, and techniques involved in, power system studies. The IEEE Brown
    Book ties together the essential fundamentals of power system studies; the most
    common studies for design or operation of a power system; and basic computational
    methods, including key information on the various types of computer systems and
    their requirements. By combining field experience in power system engineering
    with computer systems, engineers can perform detailed studies on both existing
    and proposed power systems. The planning, design, and operation of industrial
    and commercial power systems require several studies to assist in the evaluation
    of initial and future system performance, system reliability, safety, and the
    ability to grow with production and/or operating requirements. The power system
    analyses discussed in the IEEE Brown Book can help answer many questions about
    an existing system, such as the impact of expansion, the stability of the system,
    and the load distribution of the system. Chapters are devoted to different types
    of studies, and also include guidance on the preparation for these studies. Some
    of the studies discussed are: load flow studies, short-circuit studies, stability
    studies, motor starting studies, harmonic analysis studies, switching transient
    studies, reliability studies, cable ampacity studies, ground mat studies, coordination
    studies, and dc auxiliary power system analyses. As a result of focusing on computer
    studies, the IEEE Brown Book, in conjunction with other IEEE Color'
