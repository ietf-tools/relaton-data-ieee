abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to the detection and location of acoustic emissions
    from partial discharges and other sources in oil immersed power transformers and
    reactors. Both electrical (partial discharge) and mechanical sources (such as
    loose clamping, bolts or insulation parts) generate these emissions. There are
    descriptions of acoustic instrumentation, test procedures, and interpretation
    of results. When this guide is used with oil-immersed reactors, it must be understood
    that interpretation of signals may be different because of the construction of
    the reactor. Accuracy of location depends on the type of fault, configuration
    of tank, type of instrumentation and experience.
