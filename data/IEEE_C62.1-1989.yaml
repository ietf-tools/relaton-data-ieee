abstract:
- content: This standard describes the service conditions, classifications and voltage
    ratings, design tests with corresponding performance characteristics, conformance
    tests, and certification test procedures for station, intermediate, distribution
    and secondary class arresters. Terminal connections, housing leakage distance,
    mounting and identification requirements are defined. Definitions are provided
    to clarify the required test procedures and other portions of the text.
