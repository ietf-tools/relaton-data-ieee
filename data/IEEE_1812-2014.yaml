abstract:
- content: Contained in this trial-use guide are instructions for conducting tests
    to determine the performance characteristics and machine parameters of permanent
    magnet (PM) machines. The tests described may be applied to motors and generators,
    as needed, and no attempt is made to partition this guide into clauses applying
    to motors and clauses applying to generators. It is not intended that this guide
    shall cover all possible tests, or tests of a research nature, but only those
    general methods that may be used to obtain the performance data and machine parameters.
    The schedule of factory and field tests, which may be required on new equipment,
    is normally specified by applicable standards or by contract specifications. This
    guide should not be interpreted as requiring any specific test in a given transaction
    or implying any guarantee as to specific performance indices or operating conditions.The
    term specified conditions for tests as used in this guide will be considered as
    rated conditions unless otherwise agreed upon. Rated conditions apply usually
    to the quantities listed on the machine nameplate.
