abstract:
- content: It provides recommendations for the design, installation, maintenance and
    repair of trace heating equipment and associated control and monitoring equipment.
    It does not cover devices that operate by induction heating, skin effect heating
    or direct pipeline heating, nor those intended for stress relieving.This part
    supplements the requirements specified in IEC 60079-30-1.
