abstract:
- content: The effects of geomagnetic disturbances (GMD) on power transformers when
    there is the presence of geomagnetically induced current (GIC) in a power transformer
    are described. Specification parameters and performance characteristics for power
    transformers to help minimize the risk and impact when GIC is present in the power
    system are established. The intent is to provide a background that can help evaluate
    the effect of GIC on a power transformer design and its GIC capability. This includes
    the evaluation techniques to determine the performance characteristics while under
    the influence of GIC.
