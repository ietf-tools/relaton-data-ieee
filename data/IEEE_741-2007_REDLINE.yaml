abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 741-1997. This standard prescribes criteria that establish
    protection requirements for Class 1E power systems and equipment. It describes
    the purpose of and the means for obtaining protection from electrical and mechanical
    damage, or failures that can occur within a time period that is shorter than that
    required for operator action. It includes testing and surveillance requirements.
    It does not include plant physical design requirements to protect against events
    such as pipe whip, fire, dropped load, etc.
