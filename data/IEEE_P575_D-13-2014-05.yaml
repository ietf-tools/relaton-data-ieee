abstract:
- content: This guide describes the most common sheath-bonding systems now in use
    on high voltage single-conductor shielded power cables and the methods of calculating
    sheath voltages and currents, particularly as applied to three-phase systems operating
    at 60 kV and above, with the neutral grounded directly or through an impedance.
    Although the following text on induced voltages and currents in metallic sheaths
    is written primarily around high-voltage cables operating at 60 kV and above,
    the fundamental principles in this document apply equally to single-conductor
    medium-voltage shielded power cables. The term "sheath" as used in the context
    of this document is intended to refer to "non-magnetic metallic shielding" and
    the two terms are used interchangeably irrespective of whether the metallic shield
    in fact conforms to the true definition of a sheath. Cable metallic sheaths/shields
    thus covered by this guide include various types of non-magnetic shielding including
    Copper, Aluminum, and Lead sheaths, as well as helical or longitudinally applied
    metal tapes, or wires, and various combinations thereof. The user is cautioned
    to make sure that a design does not contravene any local or national regulations.
