abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011 specifies protocols, procedures,
    and managed objects that - Provide for the discovery, configuration, and control
    of a pair of direct-attached limited-function Service VLAN (S-VLAN) components
    to extend the services of a customer bridge to remote ports and enable coexistence
    of multiple services on station-resident ports (e.g., embedded bridging). - Provide
    for discovery, configuration, and control of a Reflective Relay Service for a
    bridge port. - Provide for discovery of, and coordinated configuration of, edge
    relays (ERs) and other devices that utilize the reflective relay service. - Provide
    for dynamic profile-driven port configuration.
