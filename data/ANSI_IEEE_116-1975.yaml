abstract:
- content: 'It is the purpose of this standard to provide a procedure for determining
    certain operating characteristics of carbon, carbon-graphite, electrographite,
    graphite, and metal-graphite brushes under prescribed test conditions for all
    types of rotating AC and DC motors and similar apparatus. The operating characteristics
    covered in this standard are: voltage drop, coefficient of friction, wear ratio
    as affected by low humidity, and commutating ability.<<ETX>>'
