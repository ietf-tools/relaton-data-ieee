abstract:
- content: Withdrawn Standard -- Recommendations reflecting the state of the art and
    alternate approaches to good practice for establishing characteristics of program
    design languages (PDLs) based on the syntax and semantics of the Ada programming
    language are provided. Capabilities for general methodology support, specific
    design support, and product and management information support, as well as the
    relationship of the PDL to Ada, are covered. The use of an Ada PDL is not covered.
