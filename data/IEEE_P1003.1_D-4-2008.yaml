abstract:
- content: 'POSIX.1-200x defines a standard operating system interface and environment,
    including a command interpreter (or &quot;shell&quot;), and common utility programs
    to support applications portability at the source code level. POSIX.1-200x is
    intended to be used by both application developers and system implementors and
    comprises four major components (each in an associated volume): General terms,
    concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including utility
    conventions and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions
    volume. <br><ul><li> Definitions for system service functions and subroutines,
    language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues,
    including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the
    System Interfaces volume. </li><li> Definitions for a standard source code-level
    interface to command interpretation services (a &quot;shell&quot;) and common
    utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities
    volume. </li><li> Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the
    document structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents
    of POSIX.1-200x and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers,
    is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume. The following areas are outside
    the scope of POSIX.1-200x:</li><li> Graphics interfaces</li><li> Database management
    system interfaces</li><li> Record I/O considerations</li><li> Object or binary
    code portability</li><li> System configuration and resource availability</li></ul><br>POSIX.1-200x
    describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to
    application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed
    to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and
    facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.'
