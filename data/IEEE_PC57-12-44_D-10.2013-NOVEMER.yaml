abstract:
  content: The performance, electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and the
    safety of the equipment are covered. The proper selection of such equipment is
    established as a basis for use in this standard. Certain electrical, dimensional,
    and mechanical characteristics are described; and certain safety features of threephase,
    60 Hz, low-voltage (600 V and below) network protectors are taken into consideration.
    This equipment is used for automatically connecting and disconnecting a network
    transformer from a secondary spot or grid network.
