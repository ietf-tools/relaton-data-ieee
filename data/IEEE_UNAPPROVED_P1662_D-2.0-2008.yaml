abstract:
- content: This standard applies to power electronics components and systems on ships
    and similar applications. It summarizes current electrical engineering methods
    and practices for applying power electronics in electrical power systems on ships
    and describes analytical methods, preferred parameters and performance characteristics
    from a common frame of reference for reliable integrated marine electrical power
    systems.
