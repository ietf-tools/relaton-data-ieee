abstract:
- content: The Managed Object Conformance Statement (MOCS) proforma for IEEE Std 802.9-1994
    is provided. The MOCS specified in this supplement pertains to ISLAN4-T, which
    uses 4.096Mbit/s Physical Layer transport and ISLAN20-T, which uses 20.48 Mbit/s
    Physical Layer transport. Standardization of ISLAN16-T (IEEE Std 802.9a-1995)
    and ISLANAU-AU, which specifies the AU-to-AU interworking (IEEEP802.9b) is in
    progress at this time; therefore, the specification of MOCS for ISLAN16-T and
    ISLANAU-AU is not included in this supplement.
