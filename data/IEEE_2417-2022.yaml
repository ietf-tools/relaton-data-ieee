abstract:
- content: Failures of underground cables and accessories can result in the release
    of toxic gases and large amounts of energy. These failures include smoking manholes,
    manhole fires, and manhole explosions. These failure events can damage underground
    infrastructure and pose a risk to the maintenance crews and the public. The root
    causes, prevention, early detection, mitigation, and response to failures of accessories
    and cable inside, and connected to underground electrical structures (i.e., manholes,
    vaults, handholes, etc.) are examined. Methods that can help prevent manhole events
    and methods that can mitigate the severity of manhole events are suggested.
