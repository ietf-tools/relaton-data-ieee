abstract:
- content: Enclosed low-voltage dc power circuit breakers of the stationary or drawout
    type of one- or two-pole construction with one or more rated maximum voltages
    of 300 V, 325 V, 600 V, 800 V, 1000 V, 1200 V, 1600 V, or 3200 V for applications
    on dc systems having nominal voltages of 250 V, 275 V, 500 V, 750 V, 850 V, 1000
    V, 1500 V, or 3000 V, with general-purpose, high-speed, semi-high-speed and rectifier
    circuit breakers; manually or power-operated; and with or without electromechanical
    or electronic trip devices are covered in this standard. Service conditions, ratings,
    functional components, temperature limitations and classification of insulating
    materials, dielectric withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application
    are dealt with in this standard.
