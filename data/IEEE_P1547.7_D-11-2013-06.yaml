abstract:
- content: P1547.7 is part of the IEEE 1547 series of standards. Whereas IEEE Std
    1547-2003 provides mandatory requirements for the interconnection of distributed
    resources (DR) with electric power systems (EPS), this guide does not presume
    the interconnection is 1547 compliant. Further, this guide does not interpret
    IEEE Std 1547 or other standards in the IEEE Std 1547 series and this guide does
    not provide additional requirements or recommended practices related to the other
    IEEE Std 1547 documents. However, DR interconnection may contribute to resultant
    conditions that could exceed what was normally planned for and built into the
    distribution system. This P1547.7 guide provides alternative approaches and good
    practices for engineering studies of the potential impacts of a DR or aggregate
    DR interconnected to the electric power distribution system. This guide describes
    criteria, scope, and extent for those engineering studies. Study scope and extent
    are described as functions of identifiable characteristics of the DR, the EPS,
    and the interconnection. The intent includes promoting impact study consistency
    while helping identify only those studies that should be performed based on technically
    transparent criteria for the DR interconnection.
