abstract:
- content: Methods for defining the dc load and for sizing a lead-acid battery to
    supply that load for stationary battery applications in full float operations
    are described. Some factors relating to cell selection are provided for consideration.
    Installation, maintenance, qualification, testing procedures, and consideration
    of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this recommended
    practice. Design of the dc system and sizing of the battery charger(s) are also
    beyond the scope of this recommended practice. http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/interp/485-1997.html
