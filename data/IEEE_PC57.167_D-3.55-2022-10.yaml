abstract:
- content: A classification system of liquid-filled distribution transformer types,
    risk exposures, outage impacts, unusual service conditions, and installation locations
    to help guide users in determining what monitoring parameters might be useful
    in achieving the goal of safe and continuous power delivery to customers is provided
    by this guide. Guidance on device installation, communications, and alert types
    is also provided by this guide.
