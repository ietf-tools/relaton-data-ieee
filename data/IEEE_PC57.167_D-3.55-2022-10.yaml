abstract:
- content: This guide provides a classification system of liquid-filled distribution
    transformer types, risk exposures, outage impacts, unusual service conditions
    and installation locations to help guide users in determining what monitoring
    parameters might be useful in achieving the goal of safe and continuous power
    delivery to customers. It also provides guidance on device installation, communications,
    and alert types.
