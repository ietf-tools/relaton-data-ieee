    monitor and control, and close a single project, and identifies those project
    management processes that have been recognized as good practice on most projects
    most of the time. With the third edition, the PMBOK Guide became an ANSI standard
    in 2004. It is used internationally for training and certification of project
    managers. Footnote: Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and Project Management
