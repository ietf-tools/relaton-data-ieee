abstract:
- content: Quantifying the performance of camera-equipped mobile devices is covered
    in this standard, with an emphasis on metrics and procedures appropriate to the
    types of sensors, lenses, and signal processing routines present on such devices.
    It is not intended as a general image quality standard for photographs produced
    by high-end dedicated cameras, e.g., DSLRs. Metrics include spatial frequency
    response, color uniformity, chroma level, lateral chromatic displacement, local
    geometric distortion, texture blur, and visual noise.
