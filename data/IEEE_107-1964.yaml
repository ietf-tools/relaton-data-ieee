abstract:
- content: This Standard is intended as a guide for the industry in the determination
    and presentation of test data and ratings of magnetic amplifiers. While these
    Standards are intended niainly for self-saturating linear and/or bistable magnetic
    amplifiers, appropriate items may be applied to simple saturable reactor circuits.
    It is not the intent of this Standard to require a certain fixed number of ratings
    or tests for the complete specification of a particular amplifier; rather it is
    the intent to standardize the most common ratings and tests so that when they
    are applied by the equipment manufacturer or by the user, the significance of
    the rating or test will always he the same.
