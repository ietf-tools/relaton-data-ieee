abstract:
- content: Bushings are critical components for power apparatus, as their main role
    is to conduct current at high voltage through a grounded barrier. Statistical
    studies have shown that bushing defects such as water ingression, and partial
    discharge are among the most important causes for unexpected failures. Dielectric
    Frequency Response, DFR, sometimes also known as Frequency Domain Spectroscopy,
    FDS, which involves measurement of the bushing capacitance and dielectric losses
    over a frequency range, is an effective method to detect deterioration of bushing
    insulation. This guide applies to the DFR measurement of various types of bushings
    either in the field or in the factory except for gas insulated bushings.
