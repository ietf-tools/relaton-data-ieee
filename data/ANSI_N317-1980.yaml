abstract:
- content: The monitoring of plutonium requires special instrumentation considerations
    in order to achieve optimum measurement performance. Performance specifications
    consistent with current state-of-art instrumentation technology is provided in
    this standard and is applicable to plutonium handling and storage facilities,
    excluding reactors and irradiated fuel reprocessing facilities.<<ETX>>
