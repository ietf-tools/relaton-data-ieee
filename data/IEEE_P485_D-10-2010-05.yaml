abstract:
- content: Methods for defining the dc load and for sizing a lead-acid battery to
    supply that load for stationary battery applications in full-float operations
    are described. Some factors relating to cell selection are provided for consideration.
    Installation, maintenance, qualification, testing procedures, and consideration
    of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this recommended
    practice. Design of the dc system and sizing of the battery charger(s) are also
    beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
