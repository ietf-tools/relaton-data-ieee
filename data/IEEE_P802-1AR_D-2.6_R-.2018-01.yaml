abstract:
- content: A Secure Device Identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device
    and supports authentication of the device’s identity. An Initial Device Identifier
    (IDevID) provide by the supplier of a device can be supplemented by Local Device
    Identifiers (LDevIDs) facilitating enrollment (provisioning of authentication
    and authorization credentials) by local network administrators. (The PDF of this
    standard is available at no cost compliments of the IEEE GET Program at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=68)
