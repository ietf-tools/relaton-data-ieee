abstract:
- content: The set of activities that constitute the processes that are mandatory
    for the development and maintenance of software, whether stand-alone or part of
    a system, is set forth. The management and support processes that continue throughout
    the entire life cycle, as well as all aspects of the software life cycle from
    concept exploration through retirement, are covered. Associated input and output
    information is also provided. Utilization of the processes and their component
    activities maximizes the benefits to the user when the use of this standard is
    initiated early in the software life cycle. This standard requires definition
    of a user’s software life cycle and shows its mapping into typical software life
    cycles; it is not intended to define or imply a software life cycle of its own.
