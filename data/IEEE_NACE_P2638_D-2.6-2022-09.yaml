abstract:
- content: This NACE/IEEE joint standard provides a methodology to evaluate the strength
    loss of tubular steel poles due to corrosion. Such an evaluation will allow informed,
    cost and risk-based decisions on the primary actionable asset management options
    available for such poles including continuing to monitor, remediation, or replacement.
