abstract:
- content: The increasing significance of electromagnetic compatibility considerations
    in the design and application of electrical and electronic equipment is directly
    related to the expanding sophistication of the functions performed by such equipment
    in industrial, civilian, and military activities. In order to enable the designer
    and user to be assured that equipment of concern to them will function in the
    intended application, it is necessary to control the electromagnetic environment
    adequately. The environment will vary from one application to another, as will
    the performance requirements. For this reason a variety of electromagnetic compatibility
    techniques and instruments are necessary. This specification describes requirements
    for instruments measuring quasi-peak, peak, rms and average values. To determine
    which of these need be included in any one instrument will depend upon the application.
