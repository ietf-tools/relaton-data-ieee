abstract:
- content: Directions and requirements are provided for the conversion of qualified
    power switchgear equipment. Examples such as low-voltage power circuit breakers;
    high-voltage outdoor, and medium-voltage indoor draw out power circuit breakers;
    medium-voltage fused contactors; medium-voltage ground and test devices; medium-voltage
    fused load interrupter switches; and all metal-enclosed switchgear are covered.
    Existing design standards are referenced with appropriate guidance on design testing
    necessary to design-verify the conversions. Reconditioning, which concerns the
    maintenance of existing equipment without alteration, is not covered.
