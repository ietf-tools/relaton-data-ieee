abstract:
- content: This immunity measurement and measurement instrumentation specification
    document complements the recommended procedures for making emission measurements
    as specified in ANSI C63.4. The immunity methods are alternative methods that
    might be of use to manufacturers who want to ensure a reliable product and reduce
    customer complaints by adding some additional immunity into their products beyond
    that required by law or by correcting problems experienced in the field not related
    to regulatory requirements. This document generally covers the frequency range
    of 30 Hz to 10 GHz.
