abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is for single or multiconductor cables, with
    or without metal armor and/or jacket, and rated 300 V to 35 kV AC (RMS phase-to-phase)
    or up to 2000 V dc, intended to be installed aboard marine vessels, fixed and
    floating offshore facilities (including wind facilities; excluding export and
    inter-array cables), and in accordance with industry installation standards and
    the regulations of the authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ). The recommendations
    define what is considered good engineering practice with reference to the reliability
    and durability of the cable.
