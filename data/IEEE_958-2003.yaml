abstract:
- content: A fundamental understanding of the operation, selection, and application
    of ac adjustable-speed drives on 2400 to 13 800 V auxiliary systems in electric
    power generation stations are provided in this guide. This guide applies to dc
    link type, ac adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) and does not address other drive
    systems such as cycloconverters. Included are overviews of ASD terminology, theory
    of operation, and a discussion of the factors that can influence equipment selection.
    Also defined are drive system classifications, design considerations, the interactions
    between the ASD and the electric supply system and the driven load, economic evaluation
    approaches, and typical applications. Finally, guidance on ASD specifications
    and installation are provided.
