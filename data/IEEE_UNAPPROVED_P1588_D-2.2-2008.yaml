abstract:
- content: This standard specifies a protocol enabling precise synchronization of
    clocks in measurement and control systems impletemted with technologies such as
    network communication, local computing and distributed objects. The protocol is
    applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. The protocol enables
    heterogeneous systems that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution
    and stability to synchronize. The protocol supports system-wide synchronization
    accuracy and precision in the sub-microsencond range with minimal network and
    local clock computing resources. The default behavior os the protocol allows simple
    systems to be installed and operated without reauiring the management attention
    of users.
