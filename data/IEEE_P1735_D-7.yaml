abstract:
- content: Distribution of electronic design intellectual property (EDIP) creates
    a risk of unsanctioned use and dilution of the investment in its creation. This
    standard provides guidance on technical protection measures to those who produce,
    use, process, or standardize the specifications of such electronics design descriptions.
    These measures include protection through encryption, specification, and management
    of use rights that have been granted by the producers of electronic designs and
    methods for integrating license verification for granted rights.
