abstract:
- content: This standard defines data formats to facilitate communications between
    Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems and smart RFID tags with integral
    transducers (sensors and actuators). The standard defines new Transducer Electronic
    Data Sheet (TEDS) formats based on the IEEE 1451 family of standards. This standard
    also defines a command structure and specifies the communication methods with
    which the command structure is designed to be compatible.
