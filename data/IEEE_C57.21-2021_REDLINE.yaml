abstract:
- content: All liquid-immersed or dry-type, single-phase or three-phase, outdoor or
    indoor shunt reactors rated over 500 kVA are covered. Terminology and general
    requirements are stated, and the basis for rating shunt reactors is set forth.
    Routine, design, and other tests are described, and methods for performing them
    are given. Losses and impedance, temperature rise, dielectric tests, and insulation
    levels are covered. Construction requirements for liquid-immersed reactors and
    construction and installation requirements for dry-type reactors are presented.
    This standard also covers thyristor-controlled shunt reactors used in static var
    compensators.
