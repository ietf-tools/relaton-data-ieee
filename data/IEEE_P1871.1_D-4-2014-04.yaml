abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides Instrument Description templates which
    are compliant with IEEE Std 1671.2-2012, that providers of synthetic instruments
    should use to describe waveform generators, digitizers, external local oscillators,
    and up and down converters. These synthetic instruments may be integrated in an
    automatic test system (ATS) that is to be used to test and diagnose a unit under
    test (UUT).
