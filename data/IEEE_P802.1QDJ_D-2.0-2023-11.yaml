abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q&#8482; describes the relationships and
    division of responsibilities between Centralized User Configuration (CUC) components,
    that can be used to configure end stations' use of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)
    capabilities, and a Centralized Network Configuration (CNC) component that can
    be used to configure network resources within an administrative Configuration
    Domain. A YANG model and modules that can be used by a network configuration protocol,
    such as NETCONF, to provide a CUC-CNC interface is specified.
