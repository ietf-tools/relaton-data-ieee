abstract:
- content: This guide provides information to assist in evaluating the effect of solar
    radiation on outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear including metal-enclosed bus and
    control switchboards. Specific data are given in the form of a continuous current
    capability factor for specific maximum monthly normal temperatures at the installation
    location, to adjust the continuous current capability of outdoor metal-enclosed
    switchgear to the solar radiation condition required. Tables of maximum monthly
    normal temperatures at various locations in the US and Canada are provided.
