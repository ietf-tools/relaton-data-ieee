abstract:
- content: A trial-use, non-industry-specific recommended practice for voltage sag
    and short interruption ride-through performance and compliance testing for all
    electrical and electronic equipment connected to low-voltage power systems that
    can experience malfunction or shutdown as a result of reductions in supply voltage
    lasting less than one minute is detailed in this document. Testing procedures
    and requirements for test equipment are clearly defined within this document to
    reflect this electrical environment, including single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase
    balanced and unbalanced voltage sags. Requirements for certification and test
    reporting, including characterization of voltage-sag ride-through equipment are
    also defined.
