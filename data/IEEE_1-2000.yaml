abstract:
- content: This recommended practice is intended to serve in the preparation of standards
    that are principally concerned with the thermal endurance of EIM and simple combinations
    of such materials, with the establishment of limiting temperatures of EIS, and
    with the provision of general principles for thermal classification of EIS.
