abstract:
- content: The general parameters used in the design of direct current overhead contact
    systems used in transit systems are defined in this guide. The guidelines mentioned
    in this document are intended to be used for the design of either new or expanding
    transit systems where a legacy of design standards does not exist. These guidelines
    are not intended to replace or supersede existing design standards, but to formalize
    the design process
