abstract:
- content: The recommended practice is applicable to the intermodulation (IM) level
    measurement of passive RF and microwave components, which can be caused by the
    presence of two or more transmitting signals. The conduct measurement method has
    been particularly defined in IEC 62035 for key components like cables, connectors,
    or filters etc. However, no specific requirements have been given to the anechoic
    chambers which is the main passive intermodulation PIM source of radiation measurement.
    Hence key components like wave absorber and shielding enclosure for radiation
    PIM measurement, as well as evaluation methodologies to achieve high accuracy
    will be defined. The measurement uncertainty is also discussed in this recommended
    practice
