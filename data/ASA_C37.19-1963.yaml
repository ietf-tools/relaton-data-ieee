- content: Low-Voltage AC Power Circuit Breakers. Low-voltage ac power circuit breakers
    (not molded-case breakers) with interrupting ratings of over 10,000 amp (amperes),
    1,000 volts ac or less, covered by American Standards C37.13-1963, C37.151954
    (Reaffirmed 1961) , C37.16-1963, and C37.171962. Individually Enclosed Low-Voltage
    AC Power Circuit Breakers. Low-voltage ac power circuit breakers, when in individual
    enclosures, usually built of steel for separate mounting. Low-Voltage AC Power
    Switchgear Assemblies. Low-voltage ac power switchgear assemblies, indoor and
    outdoor, including low-voltage ac power circuit breakers 1,000 volts ac or less,
    either drawout or stationary, covered by American Standard C37.20-1955.
