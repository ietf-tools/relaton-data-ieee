abstract:
- content: "\"Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this project defines a common framework for making an abstract
    model of personal health data available in transport independent transfer syntax
    required to establish logical connections between systems, provide presentation
    capabilities and services needed to perform communication tasks. The protocol
    is optimized to personal health usage requirements and leverages commonly-used
    methods and tools wherever possible."
