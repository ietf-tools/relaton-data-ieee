abstract:
- content: This guide applies to on-site acceptance tests of ultra-high voltage power
    equipment. It establishes criteria and requirements for test items, conditions,
    methods and results. The stated specifications and requirements, both technical
    and testing, are universally needed for acceptance tests on-site and commissioning
    of ultra-high voltage power equipment, including power transformers, reactors,
    capacitive voltage transformers, bushing-type current transformers, gas insulated
    switchgear, air insulated grounding switches, air insulated disconnecting switches,
    bushings, metal-oxide surge arresters, suspension insulators, post insulators,
    and insulating oil, etc. It will be sufficient for most installations.
