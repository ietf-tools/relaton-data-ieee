abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth minimum acceptable requisites for the performance
    of reliability analyses for safety-related systems of nuclear facilities when
    used to address the reliability requirements identified in regulations and other
    standards. The requirement that a reliability analysis be performed does not originate
    with this standard. However, when reliability analysis is used to demonstrate
    compliance with reliability requirements, this standard describes an acceptable
    response to the requirements.
