abstract:
- content: Safety precautions, installation design considerations, and procedures
    for receiving, storing, commissioning, and maintaining pocket- and fiber-plate
    nickel-cadmium storage batteries for photovoltaic (PV) power systems are provided.
    Disposal and recycling recommendations are also discussed. This recommended practice
    applies to all PV power systems, regardless of size or application, that contain
    nickel-cadmium battery storage subsystems.
