abstract:
  content: A thorough analysis of basic electrical-systems considerations is presented.
    Guidance is provided in design, construction, and continuity of an overall system
    to achieve safety of life and preservation of property; reliability; simplicity
    of operation; voltage regulation in the utilization of equipment within the tolerance
    limits under all load conditions; care and maintenance; and flexibility to permit
    development and expansion. Recommendations are made regarding system planning;
    voltage considerations; surge voltage protection; system protective devices; fault
    calculations; grounding; power switching, transformation, and motor-control apparatus;
    instruments and meters; cable systems; busways; electrical energy conservation;
    and cost estimation.
