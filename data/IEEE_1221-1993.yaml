abstract:
- content: Fire hazards from electrical distribution and utilization systems installed
    in industrial, residential, and public buildings/areas are covered. A method for
    practical fire hazard assessment for electrical equipment containing insulating
    materials, based on relevant fire or failure scenarios drawn from service experience
    and engineering analysis, is established. The relationship between small-scale
    material tests and large- scale fire hazard tests is discussed. Written for the
    electrical engineer responsible for the safety of electrical systems and equipment,
    this guide provides guidelines for design of insulation systems and selection
    of insulating materials and aids in the use of codes, regulations, standards,
    product listings, and testing to improve safety.
