- content: Additional computer specific requirements to supplement the criteria and
    requirements of IEEE Std 603&#x2122;-2009 are specified. Within the context of
    this standard, the term computer is a system that includes computer hardware,
    software, firmware, and interfaces. The criteria contained herein, in conjunction
    with criteria in IEEE Std 603-2009, establish minimum functional and design requirements
    for computers used as components of a safety system.
