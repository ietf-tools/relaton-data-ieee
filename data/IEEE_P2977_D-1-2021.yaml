abstract:
- content: This standard adopts MIPI Alliance??MIPI A-PHY Specification Version 1.0
    as an IEEE Standard. The standard provides an asymmetric data link in a point-to-point
    or daisy-chain topology, with high-speed unidirectional data, embedded bidirectional
    control data and optional power delivery over a single cable. In this way, it
    reduces wiring, cost and weight, as high-speed data, control data and optional
    power share the same physical wiring. For integration with existing network backbones,
    it complements Ethernet, Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, and other interfaces.
