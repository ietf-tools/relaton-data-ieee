abstract:
- content: 'Revision of IEEE Std 1512.3-2002. This standard addresses the exchange
    of vital data about public safety issues involved in transportation-related events,
    through common incident management message sets. The message sets specified are
    consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and
    are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1 or ASN) syntax. This standard
    comprises one companion volume of the family of incident management standards
    centered around a base standard: IEEE Std 1512-2006. Other members of that family
    include other companion volumes, specifying incident management message sets for
    transportation management-related data exchange and hazardous-material and public
    safety data exchange. Collectively, that family of standards shall be referred
    to as the IEEE 1512 Family of Standards. The goal of that family of standards
    is to support efficient communication for the real-time, interagency management
    of transportation-related events. Those events include incidents, emergencies,
    accidents, planned roadway closures, special events, and disasters caused by humans
    or natural events. Those events include any such event that impacts transportation
    systems or that causes a report to be received by an emergency management system,
    whether the event actually affects a transportation system and whether a response
    is required.'
