abstract:
- content: The design, manufacturing, and testing unique to the application of uncontrolled
    semiconductor power rectifiers for direct current (dc) supplied transportation
    substation applications up to 1500 V dc nominal output is covered in this standard.
    The standard is intended to address traction power substation rectifiers that
    are to be provided as part of a rectifier transformer unit or that are to be provided
    separately. Application information and extensive definitions of related technical
    terms are included.
