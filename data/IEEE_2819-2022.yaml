abstract:
- content: Uniform procedures for the measurement of the power frequency electric
    field and dc electric field when ac/dc power transmission lines are installed
    in parallel or on shared towers are established in this recommended practice.
    Based on the mutual influence analysis between parallel ac/dc power transmission
    lines through the theoretical calculation and on-site measurements, the specification
    requirements and calibration methods of electric field meters are specified. The
    measurement ranges and layout of measurement points, data recording and processing,
    and result evaluation methods of parallel power transmission lines of different
    voltage levels are standardized. This recommended practice is applicable to electromagnetic
    environment measurement of ac transmission lines with a voltage not less than
    100 kV, dc transmission lines with a voltage not less than ± 400 kV, and parallel
    transmission lines with a distance not over 100 m.
