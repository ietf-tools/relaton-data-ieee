abstract:
- content: The standard establishes a set of processes by which organizations seek
    to make their services Age Appropriate. The standard is to support the growing
    desire of organisations to design digital products and services with children
    in mind and reflects their existing rights under the United Nations Convention
    on the Rights of the Child (the Convention). While different jurisdictions may
    have different laws and regulations in place, this standard offers best practice
    for designing digital services that impact directly or indirectly on children.
    It sets out processes through the life cycle of development, delivery and distribution,
    that will help organizations ask the right relevant questions of their services,
    identify risks and opportunities by which to make their services age appropriate
    and take steps to mitigate risk and embed beneficial systems that support increased
    age appropriate engagement. One in three users online is under 18, which means
    that this standard has wide application. The age of adulthood is determined by
    article 1 in the Convention of the Rights of the Child.
