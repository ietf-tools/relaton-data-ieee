abstract:
- content: Looking at the problem from an overall standpoint, the grounding of the
    system would in most cases be done by making a metallic connection direct or through
    an impedance between transformer or generator neutrals and the building grounding
    system which is described in Chapter II. The grounding system described in Chapter
    II in turn is connected to earth through the system of ground rods and water pipes
    described in Chapter IV.The protective systems discussed for static and lightning
    protection in Chapter III would likewise be connected to the ground rods and water
    pipe system as outlined in Chapter IV.
