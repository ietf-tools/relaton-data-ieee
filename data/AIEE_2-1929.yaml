abstract:
- content: The definitions assembled in this revised Report have been taken largely
    from the latest approved sections of the A. I. E. E. Standards. In some cases
    several similar definitions are listed, these differing from each other in varying
    degrees. It was deemed desirable to again call attention to these inconsistencies
    in this way in order to expedite the work of standardization of the definitions.
    Many definitions are now included which were not in the August 1927 edition, as
    they been taken from Sections of the Standards approved since that time. Sections
    of the Standards approved since that time.
