abstract:
- content: Measuring quality of experience (QoE) aims to explore the factors that
    contribute to a user’s perceptual experience including human, system, and context
    factors. Since QoE stems from human interaction with various devices, the estimation
    should be started by investigating the mechanism of human visual perception. Therefore,
    measuring QoE is still a challenging task. In this standard, QoE assessment is
    categorized into two subcategories which are perceptual quality and virtual reality
    (VR) cybersickness. In addition, deep learning models considering human factors
    for various QoE assessments are covered, along with a reliable subjective test
    methodology and a database construction procedure.
