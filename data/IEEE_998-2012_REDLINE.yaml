abstract:
- content: Design information for the methods historically and typically applied by
    substation designers to reduce direct lightning strokes to equipment and buswork
    within substations is provided. Two approaches, the classical empirical method
    and the electrogeometric model, are presented in detail. A third approach, which
    involves the use of non-conventional lightning terminals and related design methods,
    is also reviewed.
