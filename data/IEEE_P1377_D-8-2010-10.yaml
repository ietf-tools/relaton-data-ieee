abstract:
- content: This standard provides common structures for encoding data in communication
    between End Devices (meters, home appliances, IEEE 1703 Nodes) and Utility enterprise
    collection and control systems using binary codes and XML content. The standard
    addresses the AMI and SmartGrid requirements as identified by the Office of Electricity
    Delivery and Energy Reliability of the U.S. Department of Energy; the Smart Metering
    Initiative of the Ontario Ministry of Energy (Canada) and of Measurement Canada.
    The standard exposes sets of tables that are grouped together into sections that
    pertain to a particular feature-set and related function such as Time-of-use,
    Load Profile, Security, Power Quality and more. Each standard Table Set (Data
    Model) can be expanded or restricted by the Manufacturer of the IEEE 1377 Device
    or home appliance using XML/TDL descriptive registered syntax (XML-based Table
    Definition Language) and enterprise data-value management using EDL (Exchange
    Data Language) in a manner that is machine readable. Published jointly with NEMA
    and Measurement Canada, this standard provides Tables in support of Gas, Water
    and Electric sensors and related appliances. It also provides Tables for network
    configuration and management by referencing its companion standard IEEE 1703.
    IEEE 1377 is co-published as ANSI C12.19 and MC12.19.
