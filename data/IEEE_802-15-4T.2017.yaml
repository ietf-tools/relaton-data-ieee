abstract:
- content: This amendment defines a physical layer for IEEE Std 802.15.4(TM)-2015,
    capable of supporting 2 Mb/s data rates, utilizing the 2400-2483.5 MHz band, having
    backwards-compatibility to, and the same occupied bandwidth as, the present 2450
    MHz O-QPSK physical layer, and capable of simple implementation. Target range
    should be at least 10 meters. This amendment defines modifications to the medium
    access control (MAC) sublayer needed to support this new physical layer.
