abstract:
- content: This recommended practice deals with the implications surrounding the use
    and administration of firmware revisions for protection-related equipment. In
    general, the number of firmware revisions have become prolific since the introduction
    of microprocessor-based protection related equipment and no standard means of
    dealing with the issues surrounding this situation has been addressed. This recommended
    practice attempts to provide guidelines for the effective communication of firmware-related
    issues with the intent of helping to maximize the security and reliability of
    the power system.
