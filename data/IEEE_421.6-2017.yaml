abstract:
- content: This document is intended to serve as basic reference for the specification
    and design of field discharge circuits for synchronous machines. It is also intended
    to provide detailed information about field discharge that complements standards
    IEEE 421.4.-2004 Guide for Preparation of Excitation System Specification and
    includes many aspects of the withdrawn standard ANSI/IEEE C37.18.1979 Standard
    Enclosed Field Discharge Circuit Breakers . This document shows the most employed
    field discharge circuits and defines the main design criteria and conditions for
    the main components of field discharge circuit for synchronous machines.
