abstract:
- content: This standard describes qualification methods for Class 1E vented lead
    acid batteries andracks to be used in nuclear power generating stations outside
    primary containment. Qualificationrequired by IEEE Std 308(TM) can be demonstrated
    by using the procedures in this standard inaccordance with IEEE Std 323(TM). Application
    of batteries in Nuclear Power Generating Stations can bedivided into two sections;
    duty cycles equal to or less than 8 hours and duty cycles greater than 8 hours.This
    standard provides a process to demonstrate qualification for both applications.
