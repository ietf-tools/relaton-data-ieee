abstract:
- content: The Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) identifies
    best practices for the development and execution of distributed simulations and
    the various technical and managerial issues associated with the implementation
    of these practices. This recommended practice provides the guidelines and defines
    the processes and procedures that should be followed for the verification, validation,
    and acceptance or accreditation (VV&amp;A) of a distributed simulation and provides
    a more detailed view of the VV&amp;A processes implied by and aligned with the
    DSEEP. This recommended practice is not intended to replace existing VV&amp;A
    policies, procedures, and guidance, but rather is intended to focus on the unique
    aspects of the VV&amp;A of distributed simulations. It provides a higher-level
    framework into which such practices can be integrated and tailored for specific
    uses. The VV&amp;A Overlay provides implementation-level guidance to VV&amp;A
    practitioners; however, it does not describe the individual techniques that might
    be employed to execute the VV&amp;A processes for distributed simulations. Users,
    developers, and VV&amp;A personnel working with simulations and simulation compositions
    not based upon the DSEEP can also benefit from the guidance in this document since
    the activities that this overlay describes can be tailored to support any type
    of distributed simulation application. Guidance for specific integrating standards
    [High-Level Architecture (HLA), Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), Test
    and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), etc.] is provided in the annexes.
