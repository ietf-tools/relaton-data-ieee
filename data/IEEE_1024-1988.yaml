abstract:
- content: The IEEE recommended practice covers distribution suspension type composite
    insulators made from a core, weathersheds, and metal end fittings that are used
    in the distribution of electric energy. The recommendation contains several design
    tests that are unique to composite insulators. Section 8.1 makes reference to
    tests on the materials used in the construction of the insulators and Section
    8.2 contains a test for mechanical load carrying capability under power arc.<<ETX>>
