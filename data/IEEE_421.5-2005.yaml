abstract:
- content: Excitation system models suitable for use in large-scale system stability
    studies are presented. Important limiters and supplementary controls are also
    included. The model structures presented are intended to facilitate the use of
    field test data as a means of obtaining model parameters. The models are, however,
    reduced order models and do not represent all of the control loops on any particular
    system. The models are valid for frequency deviations of +/-5% from rated frequency
    and oscillation frequencies up to 3 Hz. These models would not normally be adequate
    for use in studies of subsynchronous resonance or other shaft torsional interaction
    problems. Delayed protective and control features that may come into play in long
    term dynamic performance studies are not represented. A sample set of data for
    each of the models, for at least one particular application, is provided.
