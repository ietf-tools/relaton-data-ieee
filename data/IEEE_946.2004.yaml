abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 946-1992. Guidance for the design of the DC auxiliary
    power systems for nuclear and non-nuclear power generating stations is provided
    by this recommended practice. The components of the DC auxiliary power system
    addressed by this recommended practice include lead-acid storage batteries, static
    battery chargers, and distribution equipment. Guidance for selecting the quantity
    and types of equipment, the equipment ratings, interconnections, instrumentation,
    control and protection is also provided.
