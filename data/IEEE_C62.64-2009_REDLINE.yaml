abstract:
- content: Surge protectors for application on multiconductor and coaxial, balanced
    or unbalanced, data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages less
    than or equal to 1000 V rms or 1200 V dc are covered. These surge protectors are
    multiple-component series or parallel combinations of one or more nonlinear elements
    and zero or more linear elements. The tables of typical performance values provide
    a means of comparison among various surge protectors. They also provide a common
    engineering language beneficial to the user and manufacturer of surge protectors
    used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits.
