abstract:
- content: A set of codes and formats to be used by devices connected via the IEEE
    488.1 bus is specified. This standard also defines communication protocols that
    are necessary to effect application-independent and device-dependent message exchanges,
    and further defines common commands and characteristics useful in instrument system
    applications.
