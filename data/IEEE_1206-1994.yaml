- content: Practical methods for measuring the transmission characteristics of telephone
    handset or headset by means of using a test connection to obtain objective measurements
    are provided. The obtained test results may be used as a means of evaluating or
    specifying the transmission performance of a handset or headset on a standardized
    basis.
