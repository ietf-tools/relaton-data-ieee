abstract:
- content: Goals for the design of electrical systems that include both linear and
    nonlinear loads are established in this standard. The voltage and current waveforms
    that may exist throughout the system are described, and waveform distortion goals
    for the system designer are established. The interface between sources and loads
    is described as the point of common coupling and observance of the design goals
    will reduce interference between electrical equipment. This standard addresses
    steady-state limitations. Transient conditions exceeding these limitations may
    be encountered. This document sets the quality of power that is to be provided
    at the point of common coupling. This document does not cover the effects of radio-frequency
    interference; however, guidance is offered for wired telephone systems.
