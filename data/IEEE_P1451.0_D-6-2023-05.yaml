abstract:
- content: This standard provides the common functions, network services, transducer
    services, and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) formats for members of the
    IEEE 1451 family of standards to be interoperable in both network interface and
    transducer interface. It defines the common functions and characteristics that
    are to be performed by a network capable application processor (NCAP) which is
    a 1451 server, and all devices that implement the NCAP. It defines a set of network
    services that include a set of commands and replies to access transducer data
    and TEDS data from the NCAP (1451 server) by the Internet of Things (IoT) applications
    (APPs) that are 1451 clients. Application programming interfaces (APIs) of network
    services are defined to facilitate communications between the APPs (1451 clients)
    and NCAPs. It also defines the common functions and characteristics that are to
    be performed by a transducer interface module (TIM) and all devices that implement
    the TIM. It defines a set of transducer services that include a set of commands
    and replies to facilitate the setup and control of the TIM as well as reading
    and writing the data used by the NCAP. APIs of transducer services are defined
    to facilitate communications between the NCAPs and TIMs. It specifies the formats
    for a TEDS and methods to access the TEDS. It also defines the common functions
    and characteristics that are to be performed by an APP and all devices that implement
    the APP.
