abstract:
- content: Metal-clad (MC) medium-voltage switchgear that contains drawout electrically
    operated circuit breakers is covered. MC switchgear is compartmentalized to isolate
    components such as instrumentation, main bus, and both incoming and outgoing connections
    with grounded metal barriers. Ranges from 4.76 kV to 48.3 kV with main bus continuous
    current ratings of 1200 A, 2000 A, 3000 A, and 4000 A are the rated maximum voltage
    levels for metal-clad switchgear . Associated control, instruments, metering,
    relaying, protective, and regulating devices, as necessary, are also contained
    by MC switchgear. Service conditions, ratings, temperature limitations and classification
    of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements,
    test procedures, and applications are discussed.
