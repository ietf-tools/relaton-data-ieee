abstract:
- content: This part of ISO/IEC 29119 defines software testing techniques that can
    be used by any organization, project or smaller testing activity. The test techniques
    in this International Standard are used to derive the test cases executed as part
    of the dynamic testing process specified in part two of this standard. This International
    Standard is applicable to the testing in all software development lifecycle models.
    This document is intended for, but not limited to, testers, test managers, developers,
    project managers, particularly those responsible for governing, managing and implementing
    software testing.
