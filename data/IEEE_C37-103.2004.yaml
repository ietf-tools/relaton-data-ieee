abstract:
- content: The issues concerning testing and verification of the correctness of differential
    and polarizing circuits are described and discussed in this guide. The intention
    of this guide is to help the reader to detect errors in the wiring of protective
    relays that might cause erroneous operations of protection systems. It is essential
    to follow systematic testing procedures and record the observations in a proper
    organized manner. The records should include documentation of all measurements
    and a comparison with the desired results
