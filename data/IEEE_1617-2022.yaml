abstract:
- content: A summary of the methods for detection, mitigation, and control of metallic
    shield corrosion in 5 kV to 46 kV underground distribution cable installed in
    conduit or direct buried is provided in this guide. The causes of corrosion in
    metallic shields and the methods available to detect this corrosion are described.
    The purpose of the metallic shield and the consequences of significant loss of
    the metallic shield are discussed. Recommendations are made for the mitigation
    and control of the cable metallic shield corrosion.
