abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE 1293-1998. A guide for the preparation of a digital
    accelerometer specification and test procedure is provided. It is intended to
    provide common terminology and practice for manufacturers and users. The accelerometer
    considered utilizes a linear, single-axis, nongyroscopic accelerometer sensor
    with a permanent magnet torquer. The torquing electronics are considered part
    of the accelerometer. General design, performance, environmental, and reliability
    requirements are covered. Information on classification of tests, acceptance tests,
    qualification tests, reliability tests, standard test conditions, test equipment,
    test methods, and data submittal is given.
