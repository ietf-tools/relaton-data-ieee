- content: Single-phase instrument transformers of a nominal system voltage of 115
    kV and above with capacitive insulation system for line-to-ground connection and
    for both indoor and outdoor application is discussed in this standard. This standard
    is intended for use as a supplement to IEEE Std C57.13¿-2008 and as a basis for
    performance and safety of equipment. It also describes test sequences, criteria,
    methods, and documentation for the test.
