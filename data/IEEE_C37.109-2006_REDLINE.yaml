abstract:
- content: 'Reaffirmed March 2012. A comprehensive guide to the methods and configurations
    for the protection of power system shunt reactors is provided in this guide. The
    protection of oil-immersed reactors equipped with auxiliary power windings, improved
    turn-to-turn protection, and use of digital (microprocessorbased) protection for
    shunt reactors are included. Remarks: Revision of IEEE Std C37.109-1988'
