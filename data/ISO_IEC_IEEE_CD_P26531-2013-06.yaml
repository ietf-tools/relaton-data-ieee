abstract:
- content: This International Standard provides requirements for the management of
    the content used in product life-cycle, software, and service management system
    documentation. Content management allows an organization to control the storage
    and retrieval of content objects, track content revisions, maintain a content
    audit trail, and enable a collaborative environment. Component content management
    supports the reuse of content objects among deliverables and supports multiple
    deliverable formats. The standard defines the characteristics of an effective
    and efficient process through which content is gathered, managed, and published,
    including the requirements of a system that is supported by an electronic database.
    Such a database should support documents or topics and content units that may
    be assembled to produce complete documents for print, electronic output, or content
    collections published through electronic media. This database is defined as a
    component content management system (CCMS), as distinct from a document management
    system. The objective of component content management is to create content objects
    once and use them through linking mechanisms in multiple output formats including
    but not limited to documents. Systems conforming to this standard can fulfill
    business needs for content development and management, especially the need for
    a single source of authoritative information. The standard includes business case
    considerations for acquisition of a content management system. Content objects
    that are unique and are maintained as independent database objects are efficient
    to review, approve, and update; may be combined to produce multiple deliverables;
    and are cost-effective to translate. This International Standard is independent
    of the software tools and markup languages that may be used to manage documentation
    content, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation.
