abstract:
- content: 'Futurebus+ standards provide systems developers a set of tools with which
    high-performance bus-based systems may be developed. This architecture provides
    a wide range of performance scalability over both cost and time for multiple generations
    of single- and multiple-bus multiprocessor systems. This document, a companion
    standard to IEEE Std. 896.1-1991, builds on the logical layer by adding requirements
    for physical layer instantiation. Material in this document includes specifications
    for node management, live insertion, and profiles. It is to these profiles that
    products will claim conformance. Other specifications that may be required in
    conjunction with this standard are the following: IEEE Std 896.1-1991; P896.3,
    Futurebus+ Recommended Practices; P1212.x, Control and Status Register Architectures;
    IEEE Std 1194.1-1991, Electrical Characteristics of Backplane Transceiver Logic
    (BTL) Interface Circuits; and IEEE Std 1301.x, Metric Equipment Practices for
    Microcomputers.<<ETX>>'
