abstract:
- content: Defining and classifying industrial ultrashort pulse lasers and specifying
    the required parameters that should be included in industrial ultrashort pulse
    laser products, such as maximum average output power, pulse width, power stability,
    effective spot diameter, divergence angle, spot roundness, beam quality, signal-to-noise
    ratio, polarization direction, extinction ratio, pulse power stability, pulse
    rise/fall edge, pulse rise/fall time, position synchronized output, environmental
    reliability are discussed in this guide. This guide also provides testing methods
    for the necessary parameters of industrial ultrashort pulse lasers.
