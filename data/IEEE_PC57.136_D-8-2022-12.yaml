abstract:
- content: This guide provides information on sources of no-load and load sound in
    liquid-immersed power transformers. Industry standards that deal with transformer
    sound, and factors affecting sound levels of transformers in field operation.
    Guidelines are provided for the selection of suitable methods of reduction of
    transformer sound at the design stage, during manufacturing, and on site. Procedures
    that are typically used for determining required sound levels of power transformers
    on site are described. The intent is to provide users and manufacturers with sufficient
    background that can help produce power transformers that meet limits on sound
    level required by local sound ordinances.
