abstract:
- content: Guidelines are provided for the selection of suitable sound reduction methods
    in oil immersed power transformers and shunt reactors over 500 kVA. Sound-producing
    sources within transformers and reactors are discussed. Sound abatement procedures
    are described for achieving various levels of sound reduction in transformer and
    shunt reactor installations.
