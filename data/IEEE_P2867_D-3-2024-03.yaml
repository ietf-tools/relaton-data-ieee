abstract:
- content: Within the context of the IEEE P2867 family of standards for dc power transmitter
    of wireless charging for kitchen appliances, a normative definition of wireless
    power supply kitchen system, typical structure, interface and key component，function
    requirements and performance requirements are established in this standard. It
    specifies the use of specific term codes, formats. And behaviors in dc wireless
    transmitters in the kitchen application environment and limits the optional parameters
    and topology in the basic electrical framework.
