abstract:
- content: The design of power systems supplying lighting loads of industrial and
    commercial facilities are covered in this recommended practice. Common power system
    considerations specifically related to lighting loads are discussed, including
    voltage drop, transients, flicker, and circuiting recommendations for various
    applications. General fundamental concepts of lighting design, including common
    light sources, control methods, and application techniques, are discussed. Industry-recognized
    lighting design organizations and applicable lighting codes are discussed and
    identified as further resources for the lighting designer.
