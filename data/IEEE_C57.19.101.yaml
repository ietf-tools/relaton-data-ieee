abstract:
- content: Electrical, dimensional, and related requirements for outdoor power- class
    apparatus bushings that have basic impulse insulation levels of 110 kV and higher
    are covered. Specific values for dimensional and related requirements that are
    to be interpreted, measured, or tested in accordance with IEEE C57.19.00-1991
    are provided. Bushings covered by this standard are intended for use as components
    of oil-filled transformers, oil-filled reactors, and oil circuit breakers
