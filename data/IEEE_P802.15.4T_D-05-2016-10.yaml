abstract:
- content: This amendment defines a physical layer for IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015, capable
    of sup-porting 2 Mb/s data rates, utilizing the 2400-2483.5 MHz band, having backwards-compatibility
    to, and the same occupied bandwidth as, the present 2450 MHz 0-QPSK physical layer,
    and capable of simple implementation. Target range should be at least 10 meters.
    This amendment defines modifications to the medium access control (MAC) sublayer
    needed to support this new physicallayer.
