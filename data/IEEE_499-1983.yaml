abstract:
- content: A recommended practice for electric drives and related electrical equipment
    for installation in the cement industry is set forth. The recommendations apply
    to all electric drives and include motors, controls, and control wiring associated
    with machinery or equipment commonly used in the manufacturing areas of cement
    plants, but they do not apply to power distribution circuits. The intent is to
    promote safety for personnel and equipment, maximum reliability with minimum loss
    of production, reduced maintenance and increased life of equipment, clarification
    of needs and conditions to reduce special engineering and chance of error in specification,
    and overall economy.
