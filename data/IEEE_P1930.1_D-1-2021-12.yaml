abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice specifies an SDN middleware to support unified
    control and management of multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT) wireless
    access networks for Fifth Generation (5G) and beyond. It also defines an SDN based
    architecture, which facilitates Radio Access Network (RAN) level inter-working
    and unification of RATs.
