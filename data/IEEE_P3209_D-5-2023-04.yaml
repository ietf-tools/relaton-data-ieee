abstract:
- content: The current blockchain has problems such as a wide variety of chains, independent
    design rules for each identity account, and different cryptographic curve signature
    algorithms. If the traditional private key mode is used to manage multiple accounts
    on the same chain or multiple accounts on different chains Identity requires users
    to perform multiple backups, and faces complex management and authentication problems.
    Therefore, the design of hierarchical deterministic schemes and related proposals
    have emerged. The IEEE P3209 standard will unite many blockchain technology providers
    to jointly formulate international standards for hierarchical deterministic schemes,
    output uniform and standardized cryptographic derivation rules between different
    chains, and determine multiple blockchains through mutual signature and self-certification
    of private keys of different chains. The same identity corresponding to the public
    and private keys on the chain.
