abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 3209 will unite many blockchain technology providers to jointly
    formulate international standards for hierarchical deterministic schemes, output
    uniform and standardized cryptographic derivation rules between different chains,
    and determine multiple blockchains through mutual signature and self-certification
    of private keys of different chains. The same identity corresponds to the public
    and private keys on the chain.
