abstract:
- content: This document was prepared to provide the designers and operators of nuclear
    power plant protection systems and the concerned regulatory groups with the essential
    methods and procedures of reliability engineering that are applicable to protection
    systems. By applying principles given, systems may be analyzed, acceptable test
    intervals may be established, results may be reconciled with reliability objectives,
    and the analyses may be suitably documented. The quantitative principles are applicable
    to the analysis of the effects of random failures on protection system reliability.
    They are not intended for use in treating the problem of systematic or common-mode
    failure. The principles are applicable during any phase of a protection system's
    lifetime. They have their greatest value during the design phase. During this
    phase reliability engineering can have the greatest effect for enhancing safety.
    The principles may also be applied during the per-operational phase or at any
    time during the normal lifetime of a system. When the principles are applied during
    either of these two phases, they will aid in the evaluation of systems and in
    improving test programs. Although not inherently limited, these principles are
    intended for application to systems covered in the scope of IEEE Std 279-1971,
    Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, ANSI N42.7-1972.
