abstract:
- content: VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is defined. VHDL is a formal
    notationintended for use in all phases of the creation of electronic systems.
    Because it is both machine read-able and human readable, it supports the development,
    verification, synthesis, and testing of hard-ware designs; the communication of
    hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification, andprocurement of hardware.
    Its primary audiences are the implementors of tools supporting the lan-guage and
    the advanced users of the language.
