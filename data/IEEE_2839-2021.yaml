abstract:
- content: Requirements for functions, performance, and interface and environmental
    conditions for vital computers used in rail safety-related systems are established
    in this recommended practice. Vital computer functions are developed based on
    the technology of computer systems, communication, and functional safety as well
    as security considerations. A vital computer is composed with basic functional
    modules such as main process, input, output, and communication. This recommended
    practice can be applied to vital computers for onboard and wayside equipment in
    rail applications. Application systems which are developed based on vital computers
    are not covered, but safety-related conditions for application systems are proposed.
    The internal structure and the technical realization of the vital computer are
    not constrained in this recommended practice.
