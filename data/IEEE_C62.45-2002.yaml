abstract:
- content: The scope of this recommended practice is the performance of surge testing
    on electrical and electronic equipment connected to low-voltage ac power circuits,
    specifically using the recommended test waveforms defined in IEEE Std C62.41.2
    -2002. Nevertheless, these recommendations are applicable to any surge testing,
    regardless of the specific surges that may be applied.
