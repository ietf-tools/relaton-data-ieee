abstract:
- content: This standard provides guidelines for preparation of diagrams depicting
    logic functions. It includes definitions, requirements for assignment of logic
    levels, application of logic symbols, presentation techniques, and labeling requirements
    with typical examples. The techniques are presented in the context of electrical/electronic
    systems, but also may be applied to nonelectrical systems (for example, pneumatic,
    hydraulic, or mechanical).
