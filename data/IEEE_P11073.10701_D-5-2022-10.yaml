abstract:
- content: MEDICAL DEVICEs that offer a communication interface as specified by the
    IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards can be integrated
    into a HEALTH IT SYSTEM to jointly execute SYSTEM FUNCTIONs. However, implementing
    the IEEE 11073 SDC communication protocol is not sufficient to demonstrate safety,
    effectiveness, and security of SYSTEM FUNCTIONs resulting from the combination
    of SYSTEM FUNCTION CONTRIBUTIONs from two or more MEDICAL DEVICEs. SDC PARTICIPANT
    KEY PURPOSEs (PKPs) are sets of requirements that enable MANUFACTURERs to make
    valid assumptions about BICEPS PARTICIPANTs from other MANUFACTURERs. This common
    understanding allows for the MANUFACTURERs to perform RISK MANAGEMENT, verification,
    validation, and USABILITY ENGINEERING for the safe use of SYSTEM FUNCTIONs. This
    standard defines requirements for SDC METRIC PARTICIPANTs in an SDC SYSTEM that
    comprises an IT NETWORK of MEDICAL DEVICEs to enable safe and secure contribution
    to SYSTEM FUNCTIONs based on the exchange of METRIC information.
