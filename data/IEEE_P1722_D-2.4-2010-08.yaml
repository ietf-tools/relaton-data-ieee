abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the protocol, data encapsulations, connection management
    and presentation time procedures used to ensure interoperability between audio
    and video based end stations that use standard networking services provided by
    all IEEE 802 networks meeting QoS requirements for time-sensitive applications
    by leveraging concepts of IEC 61883
