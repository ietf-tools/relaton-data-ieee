abstract:
- content: This guide applies to low-voltage power circuit breakers of the 600-volt
    insulation class with separately mounted current-limiting Class J and Class L
    fuses for use on ac circuits with available short-circuit currents of 200 000
    amperes (rms symmetrical) or less. Low-voltage integrally fused power circuit
    breakers (see American National Standard Low-Voltage AC Integrally Fused Power
    Circuit Breakers, C37.28-1969) and combinations of fuses and molded-case circuit
    breakers are not covered by this guide.
