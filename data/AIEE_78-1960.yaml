abstract:
- content: This standard covers electrical characteristics and mechanical features
    of 3-phase, 60cycle, 2-winding, mineral-oil-immersed indoor transformers rated
    250 to 35000 kva, inclusive, high voltage 2400 to 34400 volts, inclusive, used
    for supplying electric power to direct arc ferrous-melting furnaces. 17-00.012
    All characteristics and definitions, except as specifically covered in this standard,
    shall be in accordance with the American Standard Requirements, Terminology and
    Test Code for Distribution, Power and Regulating Transformers, and Reactors Other
    Than Current-Limiting Reactors, C57.12-1958, or the latest revision thereof approved
    by the American Standards Association, Incorporated. Certain information in the
    American Standard and in this First Report may eventually be included in sections
    which will be prepared for general requirements, terminology and test code for
    arc furnace transformers.
