abstract:
- content: Electric utilities are seeking to improve the overall efficiency and performance
    of the distribution system while helping to achieve energy and demand savings.
    Distribution volt-var optimization (VVO) can play a major role in accomplishing
    these objectives while maintaining safety, preserving assets, and meeting all
    operating constraints such as loading and voltage levels. Initial studies and
    experience show there is significant potential for energy savings, demand management
    and loss reduction through improved management of distribution voltage profiles
    and reactive power flow. Consistent methods are needed for verifying the benefits
    achieved by VVO systems that have already been implemented. Guidelines for modeling
    system loads as well as distributed resources and their response to voltage and
    var changes are needed along with methods for performing the evaluations to estimate
    total benefits. These benefits can then be evaluated as a function of the investment
    requirements for the improved VVO on a feeder by feeder or substation by substation
    basis and deployment priorities can be developed.
