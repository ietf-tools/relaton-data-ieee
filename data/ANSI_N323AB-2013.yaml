abstract:
- content: Testing, calibration, and calibration frequency requirements for portable
    radiation detectors used to directly measure alpha, beta, photon, and neutron
    radiation are defined. Also defined are the calibration and testing requirements
    for alpha and beta-gamma measurements of surface contamination levels using portable
    radiation detectors. Portable radiation detectors may be battery or line powered.
