abstract:
- content: Specification and test requirements for Linear, Single-Axis, Nongyroscopic
    Accelerometers for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, linear displacement
    measuring systems, and linear rate measuring systems are defined. The specification
    format guide and test procedure standard applies to force-rebalance accelerometers
    (pendulous or translational proof mass), vibrating beam accelerometers (VBAs),
    and micromechanical accelerometers that range from lesser accuracy to high accuracy
    devices.
