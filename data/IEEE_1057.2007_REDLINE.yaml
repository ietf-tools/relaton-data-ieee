abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 1057-1994. This standard defines specifications and
    describes test methods for measuring the performance of electronic digitizing
    waveform recorders, waveform analyzers, and digitizing oscilloscopes with digital
    outputs. The standard is directed toward, but not restricted to, general-purpose
    waveform recorders and analyzers. Special applications can require additional
    manufacturer information and verification tests not covered in this standard.
    IEEE 1057 has many similarities to IEEE 1241 Standard for Terminology and Test
    Methods for Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) . However, IEEE Std. 1057 shall
    be used for waveform recorders and IEEE Std. 1241 shall be used for ADCs.
