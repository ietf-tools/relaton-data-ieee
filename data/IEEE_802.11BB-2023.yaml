abstract:
- content: Modifications to existing physical layers (PHYs) and the medium access
    control layer (MAC) that enable transparent operation of IEEE 802.11 over the
    light in the 800 nm to 1000 nm band are specified in this amendment. This amendment
    specifies PHYs that provide bidirectional operations that achieve a minimum and
    maximum throughput of 10 Mb/s and 9.6 Gb/s, respectively, as measured at the MAC
    data service access point (SAP), and facilitate interoperability among solid-state
    light sources with different modulation bandwidths.
