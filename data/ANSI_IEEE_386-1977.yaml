abstract:
- content: This standard was developed in response to a need created by the rapid
    expansion of underground distribution systems. A key element which allowed this
    expansion to become a reality is the separable insulated connector. This device
    provides for simple and inexpensive connection and switching to transformers and
    other equipment used in underground distribution.This standard establishes definitions,
    electrical ratings, tests, and interchangeable construction features for load-break
    and dead-break separable insulated connectors rated 601 V and above, 600 A or
    less, for use on power distribution systems.
