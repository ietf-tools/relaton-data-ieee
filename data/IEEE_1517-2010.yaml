abstract:
- content: A common framework for extending the system and software life cycle processes
    of IEEE Std 12207&#x2122;-2008 to include the systematic practice of reuse is
    provided. The processes, activities, and tasks to be applied during each life
    cycle process to enable a system and/or product to be constructed from reusable
    assets are specified. The processes, activities, and tasks to enable the identification,
    construction, maintenance, and management of assets supplied are also specified.
