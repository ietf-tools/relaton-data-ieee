abstract:
- content: This recommended practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision
    tests that are to be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques.
    The term “precision,” in this context, refers to tests that are conducted to evaluate
    accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish environmental
    survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining the coefficients
    of the accelerometer’s model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which
    are most accurately determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively,
    evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer output complies with specific
    error limit criteria.
