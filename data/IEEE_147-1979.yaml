abstract:
- content: This standard presents definition of components in waveguide usage. These
    components are considered to be linear, passive, and reciprocal unless otherwise
    specified. The definitions included were drawn from the Institute of Radio Engineers
    document No.53 IRE 2.S1-1953, IRE Standards on Antennas and Waveguides; Definitions
    of Terms, No.59 IRE 2.S1-1959, IRE Standards on Antennas and Waveguides; Waveguide
    and Waveguide Component Measurements, International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC) documents, Technical Committee No.46, Cables, Wires, and Waveguides for
    Telecommunication Equipment, Waveguide Vocabulary Work, Category V, Junctions,
    and Category XIII, Waveguide Components and other sources. Some definitions are
    included unchanged, some have been modified or deleted, and several new definitions
    have been added.<<ETX>>
