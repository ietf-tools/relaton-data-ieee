abstract:
- content: The Universal Power Adapter for Mobile Devices (UPAMD) standard defines
    a power delivery connection between a power adapter and a power using device greater
    than 10 W and up to, but less than 240 W. A communications link between the power
    adapter and the mobile power-using device is also defined. The communications
    may be used to coordinate the power delivery and provide identification between
    the power adapter and the power-using device. While intended for portable computing
    and entertainment devices, power adapters conforming to this standard may also
    be used with other devices (including simple devices, with no communications capabilities,
    up to 20 W).
