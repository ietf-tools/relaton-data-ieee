abstract:
- content: Five unified definitions for the 3D Body Processing ecosystem were created
    to harmonize resource exchange to enable or improve interoperability, communication,
    and security, thereby facilitating reformations across sectors and industries.
    Definitions regarding long-standing communication challenges in both the value
    chain for consumers and the supply chain for manufacturers and service providers
    in the ecosystem are addressed.
