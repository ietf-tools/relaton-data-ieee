abstract:
- content: The 3DBP IC Communications, Security and Privacy (CSP) subgroup is investigating
    the protection of data and records that may contain personal information, and
    how to ensure users and consumers expectations relative to privacy and security.
    The subgroup has determined that the requirements from the IEEE draft standards
    of P7002, P7004, and P7012 can be applied to 3DBP to help ensure security and
    privacy. Furthermore, it appears existing standards and industry practices will
    be helpful to enable the CSP to create requirements as normative clauses in a
    standard, and will use the existing standards, to the extent possible, to help
    enable safe, secure, transparent, and private processing of 3DBP information.
    In addition, the global impact of the EU GDPR will have a rippling influence on
    privacy requirements and the CSP is further assessing GDPR relative to data and
    record exchange in terms of privacy and security.
