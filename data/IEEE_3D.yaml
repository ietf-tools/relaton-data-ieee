abstract:
- content: This paper seeks to explore where current landmarking definitions have
    difficulty bridging traditional and technological practice. The paper summarizes
    current definitions in a standard format to encourage discussion toward practice
    suited for both manual and virtual environments. The goal is toward definitions
    that enable a specific placement whether that references a point, curve, position.
