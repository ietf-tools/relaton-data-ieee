abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to provide design guidance for the location
    of fences with respect to live parts within an electric-supply station. The intent
    of the fence safety clearance is to provide a reasonable safety clearance zone
    so that someone inserting an object through the electric-supply station fence
    should not contact live parts or come close enough to the live parts to violate
    the required live part to ground clearance and cause a flashover to occur. The
    safety clearance zone is necessary to minimize a possible hazard to anyone on
    the outside of an electric-supply station fence.<<ETX>>
