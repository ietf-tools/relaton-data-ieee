abstract:
- content: 'This document provides approaches for the application of distributed resources
    (DR) interconnected with the grid starting from the IEEE 1547 (including 1547a)
    requirements, but then considering the application of DR based on an overall system-wide,
    DR-system integration basis. IEEE 1547 was established based on its requirements
    being satisfied at the PCC, but 1547.8 additionally addresses DR interconnection
    considerations beyond the PCC. This 1547.8 document provides recommendations addressing
    DR interconnection system-level potential adverse effects, and, opportunities
    for EPS improvement, considering: the DR technology capabilities, interconnection
    technology capabilities, operations of the DR, operations of the area EPS, operations
    of the Local EPS, effects on power quality (voltage and frequency concerns), DR
    interconnection response to abnormal Area EPS conditions (e.g., voltage, frequency,
    faults), advanced capabilities of DR functions for supporting Area EPS operations,
    and, potential for DR to increase reliability and efficiency of electricity delivery
    and grid operations. (Note: This project was withdrawn 2016-12-07)'
