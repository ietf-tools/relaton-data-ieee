abstract:
- content: This standard establishes the graphic symbols for use in the preparation
    of logic diagrams representing logic functions implemented with two-state devices.
    The primary purpose of this standard is to enable a user to readily read and understand
    the function of the logic without requiring a specific knowledge of the constructional
    details of the device represented. This standard sets forth principles governing
    the formation of graphic symbols for logic diagrams in which the connections between
    symbols are generally shown with lines. Descriptions of logic functions, the graphic
    representation of these functions, and examples of their applications are given.
