abstract:
  content: This recommended practice describes the process of the measurement of the
    radar cross section of objects using a test range. The term “radar cross section”
    is defined, and the characteristics of different types of test ranges are given.
    The responsibilities of the test range operators are shown to involve test and
    calibration of the measurement range systems and to take the measurements accurately.
    Techniques are described for each stage of this process.
