abstract:
- content: Methods for defining the direct current (dc) load and for sizing a lead-acid
    battery to supply that load for stationary battery applications in full-float
    operations are described in this recommended practice. Some factors relating to
    cell selection are provided for consideration. Installation, maintenance, qualification,
    testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are
    beyond the scope of this recommended practice. Design of the dc system and sizing
    of the battery charger(s) are also beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
