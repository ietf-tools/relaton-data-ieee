abstract:
- content: Test requirements for conducting conformance tests on instrument transformers
    used on 60 Hz primary systems with voltages from 600 V through 38 kV. This standard
    covers selection of transformers for conformance testing, basis for conformance,
    treatment of failures, tests required, (e.g., impulse, voltage withstand, accuracy,
    temperature rise, mechanical rating), insulation system acceptance, and production
    monitoring.
