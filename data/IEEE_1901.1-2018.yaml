abstract:
- content: Physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of the medium frequency
    band (less than 12 MHz) broadband power line communication technology for smart
    grid applications (SGPLC) based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
    (OFDM) are specified in this standard. The necessary security requirements that
    assure communication privacy and allow use for mission critical and security sensitive
    services and applications are addressed in this standard. The coexistence with
    other technologies based on IEEE Std 1901(TM)-2010 also are addressed. The approach
    that is geared towards achieving an extended communication range with medium speeds
    in comparison with the existing power line communication technologies operating
    in similar frequency bands is defined in this standard.
