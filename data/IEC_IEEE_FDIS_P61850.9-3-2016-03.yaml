abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 61850 specifies a precision time protocol (PTP) profile
    of IEC 61588:2009, IEEE Std 1588-2008 applicable to power utility automation which
    allows compliance with the highest synchronization classes of IEC 61850-5 and
    IEC 61869-9.This part of IEC 61850 applies Layer 2 communication according to
    IEC 61588:2009, IEEE Std 1588-2008, Annex F, and uses peer-to-peer delay measurement
    according to the default profile of IEC 61588:2009, IEEE Std 1588-2008, Annex
    J.4 with restricted range of values.When clocks are singly attached, this profile
    is a subset of IEC 61588:2009, IEEE Std 1588-2008 with above restrictions.When
    clocks have optionally a double attachmentare doubly attached, this profile extends
    theBMCA of IEC 61588:2009,IEEE Std 1588-2008 as IEC 62439-3:2016, Annex A, specifies.
