abstract:
- content: 'This standard defines the vocabulary, data formats, and APIs for controlling
    the actuators, which helps enable the definition of interfaces between the cyber
    world and the physical world, including: - data formats for interfacing actuator
    commands defining a root schema with individual actuators, - data formats for
    recognizing actuator capabilities defining a root schema with individual actuators,
    - data formats for common data types, and - application programming interfaces
    to transmit commands and capability descriptions of the actuators between cyber
    and physical worlds.'
