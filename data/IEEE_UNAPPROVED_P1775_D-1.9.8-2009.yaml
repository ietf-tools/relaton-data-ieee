abstract:
- content: By providing test and measurement guidance as well as EMC criteria, this
    proposed EMC standard will serve as a bridge between national spectrum regulations,
    power utility practice and other interested party concerns. It is also will clearly
    identify the basic definitions of the applicable EMC parameters for BPL equipment
    and installations as well as measurements conditions and settings.
