abstract:
  content: Metal-oxide surge arresters designed to repeatedly limit the voltage surges
    on 48 Hz to 62 Hz power circuits by passing surge discharge current and automatically
    limiting the flow of system power current are discussed. This standard applies
    to devices for separate mounting and to those supplied integrally with other equipment.
