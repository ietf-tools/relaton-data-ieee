abstract:
- content: 'This standard is intended to cover procedures for testing the compliance
    of a wide variety of unlicensed wireless devices (also called unlicensed intentional
    radiators) including but not limited to: remote control and security devices,
    frequency hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum devices, anti-pilferage
    devices, cordless telephones, wireless medical devices, Unlicensed National Information
    Infrastructure devices, intrusion detectors, unlicensed wireless devices operating
    on frequencies below 30 MHz, automatic vehicle identification systems, and other
    unlicensed wireless devices authorized by a radio regulatory authority. The test
    procedures for new technology wireless devices will be added to future editions
    of this standard as soon as practical after consensus is achieved for compliance
    testing methods of the new devices. However, this standard excludes test procedures
    for unlicensed wireless devices already covered in other published standards,
    e.g., Unlicensed Personal Communication Services (UPCS) devices.'
