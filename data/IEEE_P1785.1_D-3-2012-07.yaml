abstract:
- content: This standard gives specifications for the waveguide (including aperture
    dimensions,frequency range, cut-off frequency, etc). This standard considers the
    tolerances of the waveguide aperture dimensions and the effect these have on the
    electrical properties (in terms of return loss, transmission loss, etc) of the
    waveguide.
