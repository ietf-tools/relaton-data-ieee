abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 62271 applies to all overhead, pad mounted, dry vault
    and submersible single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers
    and fault interrupters for rated maximum voltages above 1000 V and up to 38 kV.
    Devices that require a dependent manual operation are not covered by this standard.
    In order to simplify this standard where possible, the term recloser/FI (reclosers/FIs)
    has been substituted for automatic circuit recloser or fault interrupter or both.
