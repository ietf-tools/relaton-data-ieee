abstract:
- content: Replaced by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011. Guidance for the development of the
    set of requirements, System Requirements Specification (SyRS), that will satisfy
    an expressed need is provided. Developing an SyRS includes the identification,
    organization, presentation, and modification of the requirements. Also addressed
    are the conditions for incorporating operational concepts, design constraints,
    and design configuration requirements into the specification. This guide also
    covers the necessary characteristics and qualities of individual requirements
    and the set of all requirements.
