abstract:
- content: 'This is an adoption of the Moving Picture, Audio and Data Coding by Artificial
    Intelligence (MPAI)--Technical Specification Connected Autonomous Vehicle-Architecture
    as a standard. This Technical Specification specifies the architecture of connected
    autonomous vehicle (CAV) based on a reference model. The CAV is broken down into
    subsystems for each of which are as follows: functions, input/output data, and
    topology of components.'
