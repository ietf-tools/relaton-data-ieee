abstract:
- content: In this standard, information necessary to permit an effective evaluation
    of the insulation systems of medium and small rotating electric machines is presented.
    The guide is intended to apply in general to industrial air-cooled machines rated
    from 5 HP to 10000 HP. However, the procedures may be found useful for other types
    of machines. The standard covers tests to discern existing weakness, tests to
    give indication of expected service reliability, special tests, and cleaning instructions.<<ETX>>
