abstract:
- content: This guide applies to the protection of shunt power capacitor banks and
    filter capacitor banks. Included are guidelines for reliable applications of protection
    methods intended for use in many shunt capacitor applications and designs. The
    guide does not include the protection of pole mounted capacitor banks on distribution
    circuits or capacitors connected to rotating machines.
