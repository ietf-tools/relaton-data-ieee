abstract:
- content: General requirements, direction, and methods for qualifying Class 1E connection
    assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations are provided. Connectors,
    terminations, and environmental seals in combination with related cables or wires
    as assemblies are covered. Emphasis is placed on multipin, quick, disconnect-type
    connection assemblies primarily utilized for instrumentation, control, and power.
    This standard does not apply to containment electric penetrations, fire stops,
    in-line splices, or components for service within the reactor vessel.
