abstract:
- content: To meet the evolving requirements of multi-sourced data computing and sharing,
    a standard for privacy-preserving computation integrated platforms is needed.
    This standard provides requirements of privacy computation integrated platforms,
    including the reference architecture, the functional requirements, the performance
    requirements, and the security requirements of privacy-preserving computation
    integrated platforms.
