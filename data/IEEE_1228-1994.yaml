abstract:
- content: The minimum acceptable requirements for the content of a software safety
    plan are established. This standard applies to the software safety plan used for
    the development, procurement, maintenance, and retirement of safety-critical software.
    This standard requires that the plan be prepared within the context of the system
    safety program. Only the safety aspects of the software are included. This standard
    does not contain special provisions required for software used in distributed
    systems or in parallel processors.
