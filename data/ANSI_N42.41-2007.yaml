abstract:
- content: The performance criteria for active interrogation systems in homeland security
    applications are described in this standard. These systems are intended for non-intrusive
    inspection of closed containers, vehicles, and packages of a wide range of types
    and sizes. In these systems, the contents of an inspection zone are irradiated
    with penetrating ionizing radiation to determine the presence of a hidden substance-of-interest
    by the analysis of stimulated secondary radiations or nuclear-resonance absorption
    spectra that are indicative of the chemical and/or nuclidic composition of the
    substance-of-interest.
