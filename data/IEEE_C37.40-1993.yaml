abstract:
- content: Service conditions and definitions for high-voltage fuses (above 1000 V),
    distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and
    accessories for ac distribution systems are covered. These include enclosed, open,
    and open-link types of distribution cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting
    fuses; distribution oil cutouts; distribution enclosed single-pole air switches;
    power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor and indoor fuse disconnecting
    switches; fuse supports, mountings, hooks, and links, all of the type used exclusively
    with the above; and removable switch blades for certain products among the above.
