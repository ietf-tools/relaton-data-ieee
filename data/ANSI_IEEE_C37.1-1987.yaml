abstract:
- content: This standard applies to, and provides the basis for the definition, specification,
    performance analyis, and application of systems used for suervisory control, data
    acquisition or automatic control, or both, in attended or unattended electric
    substations, including those associated with generating stations, and power utilization
    and conversion facilities. This standard does not apply to electomech- National
