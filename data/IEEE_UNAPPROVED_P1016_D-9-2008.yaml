abstract:
- content: The required information content and organization for Software Design Descriptions
    (SDDs) are described. An SDD is a representation of a software design to be used
    for communicating design information to its stakeholders. The requirements for
    the design languages (notations and other representational schemes) to be used
    for conformant SDDs are specified. This standard is applicable to automated databases
    and design description languages but can be used for paper documents and other
    means of descriptions.
