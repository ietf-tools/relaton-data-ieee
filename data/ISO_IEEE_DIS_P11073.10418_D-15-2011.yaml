abstract:
- content: The scope of this standard is to establish a normative definition of communication
    between personal telehealth International Normalized Ratio (INR) devices (agents)
    and managers (e.g. cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances,
    set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages
    work done in other ISO/IEEE 11073 standards including existing terminology, information
    profiles, application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies
    the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments
    restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This
    standard defines a common core of functionality of INR devices. In the context
    of personal health devices, INR monitoring refers to the measurement of the Prothrombin
    Time (PT) that is used to assess the level of anti-coagulant therapy and its presentation
    as the International Normalized Ratio compared to the Prothrombin Time of normal
    blood plasma. Applications of the INR monitor include the management of the therapeutic
    level of anti-coagulant used in the treatment of a variety of conditions. This
    standard provides the data modeling and its transport shim layer according to
    the ISO/IEEE11073-20601 standard, and does not specify the measurement method.
