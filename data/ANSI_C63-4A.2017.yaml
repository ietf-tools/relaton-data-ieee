abstract:
- content: U.S. consensus standard methods are specified in Annex D of this amendment
    for validating standard test sites and alternative test sites used for measurement
    of radiated radio-frequency (RF) signals and noise emitted from electrical and
    electronic devices in the frequency range of 30 MHz to 1 GHz. In addition, various
    updates are made to equations in 4.5, Annex F, Annex G, and Annex N.
