abstract:
- content: The purpose of this procedure to define uniform acceptable test methods
    for determining the performance and other characteristics of aircraft alternating-current
    generators. Rotating electric equipment for aircraft is subjected to requirements
    and operating conditions not normally encountered by commercial generators. For
    example, conditions of temperature, altitude, humidity, and vibration vary over
    much wider ranges. Aircraft requirements dictate minimum weight, and yet utmost
    reliability is essential. Weight reduction is generally achieved by sacrifice
    of life expectancy commensurate with aircraft practices. The necessity for accurate
    design requires that direct measurements to insure reliability and adequate life
    be an important part of this test procedure. It is recognized that there may be
    acceptable methods of making tests other than those described. Such other methods
    may be considered as alternative procedures accepted by agreement between interested
    parties. The tests outlined herein are not necessarily complete for any specific
    generator; and likewise the requirements in each case will determine the number
    of tests to be made.
