abstract:
- content: This standard contains the Management Information Base (MIB) module specifications
    for IEEE Std 802.3, also known as Ethernet. It includes the Structure of Management
    Information Version 2 (SMIv2) MIB module specifications formerly produced and
    published by the Internet EngineeringTask Force (IETF), and the Guidelines for
    the Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO)MIB modules formerly specified within
    IEEE Std 802.3, as well as extensions resulting from amendments to IEEE Std 802.3.
    The SMIv2 MIB modules are intended for use with the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP), commonly used to manage Ethernet.
