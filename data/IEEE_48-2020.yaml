abstract:
- content: Test procedures and requirements are provided for all indoor and outdoor
    cable terminations used on alternating-current shielded cables having laminated
    insulation rated 2.5 kV through 765 kV and extruded insulation rated 2.5 kV through
    500 kV, except separable insulated connectors, which are covered by IEEE Std 386&#8482;-2016
    [B18]. Cable terminations and component parts shall be capable of withstanding
    the tests specified in this standard.
