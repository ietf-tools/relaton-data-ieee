abstract:
- content: An aid to users to determine (1) the allowable continuous current class
    (ACCC), (2) the continuous load current capabilities of air switches under various
    conditions of ambient temperature, and (3) the emergency load current capabilities
    of air switches under various conditions of ambient temperature, is provided.
