abstract:
  content: Procedures and test voltage values for acceptance and maintenance testing
    of electric submersible pump (ESP) cable systems are presented. This recommended
    practice applies to cable systems rated 3 kV and 5 kV (phase to phase) and is
    intended only for this special-purpose cable. The intent is to provide uniform
    test procedures and guidelines for evaluation of the test results.
