abstract:
- content: The purpose of this trial-use standard is to provide common terminology
    and test methods for describing the performance of waveform recorders. Since these
    devices give only digital answers that are intended to be sent to a computer for
    analysis, a highly analytical approach has been taken, perhaps more than other
    instrumentation standards committees. Instruments covered by this trial-use standard
    are electronic digitizing waveform recorders, waveform analyzers, and digitizing
    oscilloscopes with digital outputs. This trial-use standard is directed toward,
    but not restricted to, general-purpose waveform recorders and analyzers. Special
    applications may require additional manufacturer information and verification
    tests.<<ETX>>
