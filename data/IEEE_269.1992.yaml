abstract:
  content: 'Superseded by IEEE Std 269-2002. Practical methods for measuring the transmission
    characteristics of both digital and conventional to wire analog telephone sets
    by means of objective measurements on a test connection are described. The test
    results thus obtained may be used as a means of evaluating or specifying the transmission
    performance of a telephone set on a standardized basis. The measurements are applicable
    to telephone sets incorporating carbon or linear transmitters. Measurements are
    over the frequency range most useful for speech: 100-5000 Hz. The test methods
    are not intended to be applicable to special devices, such as noise-exclusion
    transmitters, distant-talking transmitters, insert-type receivers, or noise-exclusion
    receivers equipped with large ear pads.'
