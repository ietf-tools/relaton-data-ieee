abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 982.1-2005 A set of measures indicative of software
    reliability that can be applied to the software product as well as to the development
    and support processes is provided. The measures can be applied early in the development
    process to indicate the reliability of the delivered product. The aim is to provide
    a common set of definitions that allows a meaningful exchange of data and evaluations
    to occur, and that serves as the foundation on which researchers and practitioners
    can build consistent methods. The standard is designed to assist management in
    directing product development and support toward specific reliability goals.
