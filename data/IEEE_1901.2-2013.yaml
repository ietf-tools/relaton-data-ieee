abstract:
- content: A worldwide standard for narrowband power line communications (PLC) via
    alternating current, direct current, and nonenergized electric power lines using
    frequencies below 500 kHz. Data rates of up to 500 kb/s are supported. The field
    of use includes Smart Grid applications. Coexistence mechanisms that can be used
    by other PLC technologies operating below 500 kHz are also included. These coexistence
    mechanisms may be used separately from the rest of the standard.
