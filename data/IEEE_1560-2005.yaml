abstract:
- content: Uniform methods of measurements of radio-frequency power-line interference
    filterattenuation performance in the range of 100 Hz to 10 GHz are set forth.
    Nonloaded and loaded attenuation measurements are presented with varying source
    impedance, including radiofrequency current injection with linear and nonlinear
    load impedances. H- and S-parameter measurements are introduced for modeling results.
    New methods for placing filter performance criteria on a filter label are also
    included.
