abstract:
- content: A set of high-efficiency video coding tools, including intra prediction,
    inter prediction, transform, entropy coding and loop filter, and corresponding
    decoding procedure, is defined in this standard. The target applications and services
    include, but are not limited to, digital television broadcasting, IPTV, video
    surveillance, video conference, Internet video streaming, and other video/audio-enabled
    services and applications such as user-generated multimedia content, digital storage
    media, and communication.
