abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748 provides unified and consolidated guidance on the life
    cycle management of systems and software. This document focuses on the processes
    required for successful planning and management of the project's software development
    effort and for development of the software development plan (SDP) as a vehicle
    for representing a project's application of software life cycle processes. The
    SDP is a top level technical planning document for a project which addresses technical
    management processes established by three principal sources (the project s contract,
    applicable organizational and technical management processes, and the software
    development project team) as necessary to successfully accomplish the software
    development related tasks of the project.
