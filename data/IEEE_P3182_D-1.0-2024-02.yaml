abstract:
- content: This standard establishes terminologies and a framework for Percutaneous
    and Nonfluoroscopic Technology (PAN technology) which is conducted by ultrasound
    in a percutaneous cardiovascular interventional therapy. This standard can promote
    the communication and cooperation with various stakeholders under a unified terminology
    and framework; as well as overcome differences to make technology more reliable,
    efficient and safer. The standardization of PAN technology will help scale up
    solution, satisfy people’s needs and promote healthcare services sustainable developments.
