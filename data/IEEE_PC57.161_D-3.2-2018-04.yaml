abstract:
- content: Dielectric Frequency Response (DFR) test methods of liquid immersed transformers
    are discussed in this guide. The guide includes recommendations for instrumentation,
    procedures for performing the tests, and techniques for analyzing the data. This
    guide describes factors affecting the DFR test moisture estimate including winding
    configuration and measurement set-up, cellulose material type, low molecular weight
    acids, and background ac/dc noise interference. This guide is applicable to both
    field and factory applications. The purpose of this guide is to provide the user
    with information that will assist in performing Dielectric Frequency Response
    measurements and interpreting the results from these measurements.
