abstract:
- content: Onshore power supply systems need communication between the ship side and
    the shore side. Different kinds of communication have to be distinguished, see
    Clause 3. This Part 2 of IEC/IEEE 80005 series deals with the non-safety related
    communication. It covers the requirements of the HVSC systems described in Part
    1 and is also intended to cover the requirements of a forthcoming standard for
    LV shore connection systems. This part of IEC/IEEE 80005 describes the data interfaces
    of shore and ships as well as step by step procedures for low and high voltage
    shore connection systems communication for non-emergency functions, where required.
    This standard specifies the interface descriptions, addresses and data type. This
    standard also specifies communication requirements on cruise ships, in Annex A.
    Application of this standard relates to annexes of IEC/ISO/IEEE 80005-1. This
    standard does not specify communication for emergency functions as described in
    IEC/ISO/IEEE 80005-1.
