abstract:
- content: Theory, application of phase-shifting transformers, and the difference
    of specification and testing to standard system transformers are described. Various
    types of phase-shifting transformers and how to select the optimal design to achieve
    required control of power flow are covered. An understanding of the terminology,
    types, construction, and testing specifical to phase-shifting transformers is
    provided. Replaced by IEC 62032 Ed.1 (2005-03)
