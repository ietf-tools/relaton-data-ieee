abstract:
- content: Background information on supply voltage fluctuations caused by fluctuations
    in power demands of installations is provided by this standard. The manifestation
    of these supply voltage fluctuations as lamp flicker is presented in this standard.
    A flicker measurement method using a meter that is described in IEC 61000-4-15
    is presented in this standard. The short-term (Pst) and long-term (Plt) indices
    used for the quantification of lamp flicker are defined in this standard. For
    different system voltages, planning levels for flicker that the utilities need
    their system to be limited to in order to reduce customer complaints are defined
    in this standard. The procedure for determining emission limits for individual
    installations at the point of common coupling (PCC) so that the planning levels
    can be achieved in practice is defined in this standard. Then, an assessment procedure
    for evaluating flicker compliance against emission limits is described. Methodologies
    to analyze background flicker to identify the flicker contribution of individual
    sources are also presented in this standard. Rapid voltage changes (RVCs) that
    are caused by various system events such as switching of capacitor banks, energization
    of power transformers, and starting of induction motors are also addressed by
    this standard. Methods to estimate flicker or RVCs at the PCC for various types
    of fluctuating installations are provided by this document. Example terms and
    language that can be the basis for defining relative responsibilities and assessment
    methods for installations that may cause flicker and RVCs are included in the
    document.
