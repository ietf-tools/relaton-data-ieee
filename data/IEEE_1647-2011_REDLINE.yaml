abstract:
- content: The e functional verification language is an application-specific programming
    language, aimed at automating the task of verifying a hardware or software design
    with respect to its specification. Verification environments written in e provide
    a model of the environment in which the design is expected to function, including
    the kinds of erroneous conditions the design needs to withstand. A typical verification
    environment is capable of generating user-controlled test inputs with statistically
    interesting characteristics. Such an environment can check the validity of the
    design responses. Functional coverage metrics are used to control the verification
    effort and gauge the quality of the design. e verification environments can be
    used throughout the design cycle, from a high-level architectural model to a fully
    realized system. A definition of the e language syntax and semantics and how tool
    developers and verification engineers should use them are contained in this standard.
