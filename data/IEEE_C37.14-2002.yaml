- content: Reaffirmed 2008. Revision of IEEE Std C37.14-1999. This IEEE Standards
    product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations and Protective Relays.
    Abstract:This standard covers enclosed low-voltage dc power circuit breakers of
    the stationary or draw-out type of one- or two-pole construction with one or more
    rated maximum voltages of 300 V, 325 V, 800 V, 1000 V, 1200 V, 1600 V, or 3200
    V for applications on dc systems having nominal voltages of 250 V, 275 V, 750
    V, 850 V, 1000 V, 1500 V, or 3000 V, with general-purpose, high-speed, semi-high-speed
    and rectifier circuit breakers; manually or power-operated; and with or without
    electromechanical or electronic trip devices. It deals with service conditions,
    ratings, functional components, temperature limitations and classification of
    insulating materials, dielectric withstand voltage requirements, test procedures,
    and application.
