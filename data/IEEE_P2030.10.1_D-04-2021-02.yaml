abstract:
- content: This standard provides specifications for DC-based installations to address
    requirements given in Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the Multi-Tier framework. The Multi-Tier
    framework is discussed in detail in the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
    (ESMAP) report published by the World Bank. This standard provides installation
    rules for basic electricity supply from a renewable source and is meant to be
    used in areas that are not connected to the AC public distribution network. The
    standard advocates use of a safety extra low voltage that can be safer to operate
    under normal, dry conditions. Circuit/branch current is limited to make it more
    difficult for an arc to propagate. This approach delivers power access possible
    without needing special parts. The resultant installation can use wiring that
    is similar to that used in an AC system in a cost-effective and scalable manner.
