abstract:
  content: This standard specifies procedures for managing user documentation throughout
    the software life cycle. It applies to people or organizations producing suites
    of documentation, to those undertaking a single documentation project, and to
    documentation produced internally, as well as to documentation contracted to outside
    service organizations. It provides an overview of the software documentation and
    information management processes, and also presents aspects of portfolio planning
    and content management that user documentation managers apply. It covers management
    activities in starting a project, including setting up procedures and specifications,
    establishing infrastructure, and building a team. It includes examples of roles
    needed on a user documentation team. It addresses measurements and estimates needed
    for management control, and the use of supporting processes such as change management,
    schedule and cost control, resource management, and quality management and process
    improvement. It includes requirements for key documents produced for user documentation
    management, including documentation plans and documentation management plans.
    The standard is independent of the software tools that may be used to produce
    or manage documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen
    documentation. Much of its guidance is applicable to user documentation for systems
    including hardware as well as software.
