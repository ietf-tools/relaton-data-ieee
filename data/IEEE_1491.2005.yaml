abstract:
- content: Monitoring and measurement of battery parameters is an important element
    of maintaining a fully operational battery system. This guide presents and discusses
    measurable parameters of batteries used in stationary battery systems and the
    utilization of such observations. This guide does not give a listing of commercially
    available systems, but it does provide a means of establishing specifications
    for the desired parameters monitored
