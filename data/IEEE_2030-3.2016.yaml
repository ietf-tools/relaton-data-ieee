abstract:
- content: Applications of electric energy storage equipment and systems (ESS) for
    electric power systems (EPSs) are covered. Testing items and procedures, including
    type test, production test, installation evaluation, commissioning test at site,
    and periodic test, are provided in order to verify whether ESS applied in EPSs
    meet the safety and reliability requirements of the EPS. Grid operators, ESS manufactures,
    and ESS operators are for whom this standard is established.
