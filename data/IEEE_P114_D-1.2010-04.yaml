abstract:
  content: This standard covers instructions for conducting and reporting the more
    generally applicable and acceptabletests to determine the performance characteristics
    of single-phase induction motors. It is not intended thatthis standard shall cover
    all possible tests used in production or tests of a research nature. The standardshall
    not be interpreted as requiring the making of any or all of the tests described
    herein in any giventransaction.
