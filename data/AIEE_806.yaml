abstract:
- content: It is the purpose of this procedure to define uniform acceptable test methods
    for determining the performance and other characteristics of aircraft alternating-current
    generators. It is recognized that there may be acceptable methods of making tests
    other than those described. The tests outlined are not necessarily complete for
    any specific generator; and likewise the requirements in each case will determine
    the number of tests to be made.<<ETX>>
