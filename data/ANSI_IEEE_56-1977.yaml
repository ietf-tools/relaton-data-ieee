abstract:
- content: The purpose of this IEEE guide is to present information necessary to permit
    an effective evaluation of the insulation systems of large alternating-current
    rotating electrical machines. Such an evaluation can serve as a guide to the degree
    of maintenance or replacement which might be deemed necessary, and also offer
    some indication of the future service reliability of the equipment under consideration.
    The guide is intended to apply in general to large alternating-current rotating
    electrical machines rated at 10000 kVA or more, and operating at voltages of 6000
    V and above.
