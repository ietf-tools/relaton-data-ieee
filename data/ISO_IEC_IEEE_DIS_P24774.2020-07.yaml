abstract:
- content: A number of international, national and industry standards describe processes
    and process models. Process models are developed for a range of purposes including
    process implementation and assessment. In order for users of standards to select
    the appropriate forms of process description and apply them in a consistent fashion,
    it is desirable to develop a common characterization of all of these forms of
    process description. This document presents requirements for the description of
    processes in terms of their format, content and level of prescription. Because
    of the wide usage of process descriptions, process elements are categorized as
    “Required” or “Optional”. Although developed within ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC7 &#8211; Systems
    and software engineering, the requirements of this document can be applied to
    any process model or description developed for any purpose.
