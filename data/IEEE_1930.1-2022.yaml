abstract:
- content: A software-defined networking (SDN) middleware is outlined in this recommended
    practice to support unified control and management of multiple radio access technology
    (multi-RAT ) wireless access networks for fifth generation (5G) and beyond. An
    SDN architecture is also defined, which facilitates radio access network (RAN)
    level interworking and unification of RATs.
