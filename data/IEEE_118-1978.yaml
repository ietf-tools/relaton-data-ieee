abstract:
- content: Methods of measuring electrical resistance that are commonly used to determine
    the characteristics of electric machinery and equipment are presented. The methods
    are limited to those using direct-current or commercial power frequencies of 60
    Hz or below, and to those measurements required to determine performance characteristics.
    The choice of method in any given case depends on the degree of accuracy required
    and the nature of the circuit to be measured; a guide for selecting the appropriate
    method is given.
