abstract:
- content: The IEEE 287 series of documents presents the combined efforts of IEEE
    P287 Working Group that reflect the knowledge and experience of leading specialists
    in the development and measurement of precision coaxial connectors for RF, microwave,
    and millimeter-wave frequencies. It presents minimum performance requirements
    to standardize both hermaphroditic and pin and socket-type connectors (IEEE Std
    287.1-2021, this document). It provides recommended electrical and mechanical
    test procedures for Instrument Grade and Metrology Grade precision connectors
    (IEEE Std 287.2-2021). Recommended reference procedures including connector effects,
    connector care and cleaning, connector repeatability and reproducibility test
    procedures, and a color code for connectors are detailed in the third part of
    the series (IEEE Std 287.3- 2021). A bibliography provides a list of pertinent
    references for measurement techniques used in determining electrical, mechanical,
    and dimensional parameters for coaxial connectors.
