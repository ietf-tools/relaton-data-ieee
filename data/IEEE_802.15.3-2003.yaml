abstract:
- content: The protocol and compatible interconnection of data and multimedia communication
    equipment via 2.4 GHz radio transmissions in a Wireless Personal Area Network
    (WPAN) using low power and multiple modulation formats to support scalable data
    rates is defined in this standard. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer protocol
    supports both isochronous and asynchronous data types
