abstract:
- content: The mechanisms and an analytic approach for developing consistent rules,
    agreements, and/or methodologies for the evaluation and inter-entity cooperation
    managing pole attachments on utility infrastructure that can contain both electric
    supply as well as communications wireline and wireless facilities are identified
    by this guide. The common safety codes and accepted good industry practices for
    joint use are referenced, including items such as clearances and strength/loading
    requirements; appropriate work rules during installation, maintenance, and restoration;
    and general guidelines. The considerations within this guide can be used to help
    perform a detailed assessment of attachment installations where communications
    antennas and related wireline and wireless equipment are to be colocated on joint
    use structures.
