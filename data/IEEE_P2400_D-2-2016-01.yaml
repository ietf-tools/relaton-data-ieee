abstract:
- content: The wind turbine in a wind farm can produce Amplitude Modulation Noise
    (AMN) is known to be caused by rotating airfoil self-noise particularly trailing
    edge scattering noise and Doppler effect due to blade motion relative to observer,
    it is also recognized as Swish sound. Envelop of the acoustic wave appeared to
    be blade passing frequency; therefore it gives people impression that it is Low
    Frequency with blade passing frequency noise. Meanwhile, the sound pressure pulsation
    due to blade aerodynamic loading fluctuation and blade tower interaction characterized
    as Low Frequency Noise (LFN) including infrasound were observed from indoor measurement
    near wind turbine in operation. The AMN and LFN are both identified as wind turbine
    aero acoustic noise that have been complained to be the most annoying to residents
    near wind farm, such as sleep disturbance, nausea, giddiness and etc. The issue
    becomes more concerned to public as more wind farm projects built with modern
    powerful wind turbine deploying larger and longer blade. However, the current
    IEC 61400-11 noise measurement standard did not address this issue, especially
    in far field indoor condition. To address this issue, IEEE has started a standard
    development project P2400 in Oct.2013. This standard establishes standard measurement
    techniques and methods of analysis to quantify wind turbine and wind farm aero
    acoustic noise. It can be used to understand wind turbine aero acoustic noise
    so called low frequency/infrasound and amplitude modulation noise and potential
    impacts on surrounding communities. This document provides the standard measurement
    techniques for wind turbine aero acoustic noise including instrumentation selection,
    measurement setup near field, far-field outdoor and indoor, post-data processing
    and noise source data analysis. IEC 61400-11 has provided overall wind turbine
    noise measurement standard, while this document focuses more aero acoustic noise
    of wind turbine and the difference from IEC 61400-11 to avoid the overlap. It
    is advised that use of this document also with familiarity of ANSI S1.1-1994 (R2004)
    Acoustical Terminology.
