abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.93-2007.This guide provides guidance and recommended
    practices on the installation and maintenance of liquid-immersed power transformers
    rated 501 kVA and above with secondary voltages of 1000 V and above. This guide
    covers the entire range of power transformers, including extra high voltage (EHV)
    transformers. This guide does not cover special transformers such as furnace transformers,
    rectifier transformers etc. Distinctions are made as required for various MVA
    ratings, voltage ratings, and types of liquid insulation.
