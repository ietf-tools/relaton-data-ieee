abstract:
- content: Test specifications with a set of indicators for common corruption and
    adversarial attacks, which can be used to evaluate the robustness of artificial
    intelligence-based image recognition services are provided in this standard. Robustness
    attack threats and establishes an assessment framework to evaluate the robustness
    of artificial intelligence-based image recognition service under various settings
    are also specified in this standard.
