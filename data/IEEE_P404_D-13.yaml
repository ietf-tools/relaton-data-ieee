abstract:
- content: 'Std. 404-2000, IEEE Standard for Extruded and Laminated Dielectric Shielded
    Cable Joints Rated 2 500v to 500 000v, will be revised to incorporate: 1) design
    tests for joint environmental seals; 2) quality control requirements for production
    lots of heat shrinkable joint designs; 3) metallic shielding performance criteria;
    and 4) additional temperature / current rating performance criteria. These revisions
    will be harmonized with international standards wherever possible.'
