abstract:
- content: Techniques to select wind turbine and wind farm aero acoustic noise measurements,
    including instrumentation standards and metrology technology, measurement set,
    measurement procedures, data processing, and noise source data analysis are described
    in this standard. Nearfield sound measurement similar to IEC 61400-11 distance
    and far-field sound measurement both outside and inside concerned houses or buildings
    are within the scope of this standard. This standard focuses on amplitude modulation
    noise, however, guidelines for low-frequency noise including infrasound near-field
    measurement are provided. IEC 61400-11 provides overall wind turbine noise measurement
    standards, while this standard focuses more on the aero acoustic noise of wind
    turbines to avoid overlap with IEC 61400-11.
