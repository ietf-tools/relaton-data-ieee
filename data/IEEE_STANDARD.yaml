abstract:
- content: 'The common functions, network services, transducer services, and Transducer
    Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) formats for members of the IEEE 1451 family of standards
    to be interoperable in both network interface and transducer interface are provided.
    The common functions and characteristics that are to be performed by a network
    capable application processor (NCAP), which is a 1451 server, and all devices
    that implement the NCAP are defined. A set of network services that includes a
    set of commands and replies to access transducer data and TEDS data from the NCAP
    (1451 server) by the Internet of Things (IoT) applications (APPs) that are 1451
    clients are also defined. Application programming interfaces (APIs) of network
    services are outlined to facilitate communications between the APPs (1451 clients)
    and NCAPs. Furthermore, the common functions and characteristics that are to be
    performed by a transducer interface module (TIM) and all devices that implement
    the TIM are discussed. A set of transducer services that includes a set of commands
    and replies to facilitate the setup and control of the TIM, as well as reading
    and writing the data used by the NCAP, are outlined. APIs of transducer services
    are also discussed to facilitate communications between the NCAPs and TIMs. Finally,
    the formats for a TEDS and methods to access the TEDS are specified, along with
    the common functions and characteristics that are to be performed by an APP and
    all devices that implement the APP. Additional Open Source content available here:
