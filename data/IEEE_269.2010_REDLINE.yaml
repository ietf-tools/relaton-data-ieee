abstract:
  content: Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic
    characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets and headsets. The methods
    may also be applicable to a wide variety of other communications equipment, including
    cordless, wireless and mobile communications devices. Measurement results may
    be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized basis. Application is in the
    frequency range from 100 Hz to 8500 Hz. This edition incorporates IEEE Std 269a-2007.
    Other substantive changes have been made since the 2002 edition. This document
    contains sound files. If not delivered with PDF, are available at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/269/269-2010/
