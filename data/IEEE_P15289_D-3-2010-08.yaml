abstract:
- content: 'This International Standard was developed to assist users of systems and
    software life cycle processes to manage information items (documents). It is based
    on the life cycle processes specified in ISO/IEC 12207:2008, Systems and software
    engineering Software life cycle processes; ISO/IEC 15288:2008, Systems and software
    engineering System life cycle processes; and the service management processes
    specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2005, Information technology -- Service management
    -- Part 1: Specification; and ISO/IEC 20000-2:2005, Information technology --
    Service management -- Part 2: Code of practice. The IEEE Computer Society and
    ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC7 participated in the joint development of this International
    Standard. IEEE contributed IEEE 12207.1-1997 Industry Implementation of International
    Standard ISO/IEC 12207: 1995 (ISO/IEC 12207) Standard for Information TechnologySoftware
    life cycle processes Life cycle data as a source for this standard. Information
    items are essential to preserving what transpired when using system life cycle
    processes, and may be identified as deliverable documents. The information items
    identified in ISO/IEC 15289 aid in planning, producing, and evaluating the results
    of the life-cycle processes. This International Standard identifies the purpose
    and content of systems and software life cycle information items (documentation)
    as required for the various life cycle processes. The information item contents
    are defined according to generic document types and the specific purpose of the
    document. This International Standard may be applied to any of the activities
    and tasks of a project, system or software product, or service life cycle. It
    is not limited by the size, complexity or criticality of the project. It may be
    applied to all forms of information items, information item content, and document
    delivery media. Information items may be combined or subdivided as needed for
    project or organizational purposes.'
