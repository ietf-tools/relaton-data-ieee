abstract:
- content: This guide presents information regarding the essential subsystems that
    make up a fossil-fueled unit-connected boiler-turbine-generator station and describes
    typical interlocking, control, and protection for operating them in a coordinated
    order to ensure proper start-up and safe shutdown. The primary purpose of this
    guide is to provide a basis for qualitative evaluation of overall design of a
    unit-connected fossil fuel plant, and writing general operating guides of an educational
    nature, thereby serving to aid in acquainting personnel with boiler-turbine-generator
    systems. Every new fossil plant will have its own special operating sequence due
    to the type of equipment installed and its operating company's practices. However,
    this guide purports to include in one document a description of various cycles
    in a power plant, their sequence of operation, and protection procedures.<<ETX>>
