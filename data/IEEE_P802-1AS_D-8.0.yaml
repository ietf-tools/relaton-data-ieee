abstract:
- content: Protocols, procedures, and managed objects for the transport of timing
    over local area networks are defined in this standard. It includes the transport
    of synchronized time, the selection of the timing source (i.e., best master),
    and the indication of the occurrence and magnitude of timing impairments (i.e.,
    phase and frequency discontinuities).
