abstract:
- content: IEC/IEEE 60079-30-1 is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of
    the essential requirements and testing appropriate to electric surface heating
    equipment used in explosive atmospheres. The requirements of this part of IEC
    60079 are considered to be the minimum requirements for equipment protection levels
    Gb, Gc, Db, and Dc in explosive atmospheres for gases, dusts, and fibres/flyings.
    While some of this work already exists in national standards or international
    standards, this standard has collated much of this existing work and considerably
    added to it. This standard also contains the minimum requirements for users applying
    the Division method of area classification.
