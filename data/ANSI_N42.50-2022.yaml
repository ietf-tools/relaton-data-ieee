abstract:
- content: Minimum performance requirements and performance testing requirements are
    specified in this standard for instruments designed to measure radon progeny in
    air. Inasmuch as the health effects of exposure to radon progeny, and hence regulatory
    control, are quantified relative to the ultimate dose delivered by the complete
    decay of all the radon progeny in the monitored air, the principle measurand of
    interest is therefore the potential alpha energy concentration, expressed in units
    of either working level (WL) or joules m-3 given that primary measurements characterize
    activity. The needs of users, manufacturers, and regulators concerned with radon
    progeny measurements are addressed in this standard.
