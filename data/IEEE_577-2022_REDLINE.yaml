abstract:
- content: The minimum acceptable requirements for the performance of reliability
    analyses for safety systems when used to address the reliability considerations
    discussed in industry standards and guidelines are set forth in this standard.
    The requirement that a reliability analysis be performed does not originate with
    this standard. However, when reliability analysis is used to demonstrate compliance
    with reliability requirements, this standard describes an acceptable response
    to the requirements.
