abstract:
- content: EME2-AES and XCB-AES wide-block encryption with associated data (EAD) modes
    of the NIST AES block cipher, providing usage guidelines and test vectors, are
    described. A wide block encryption algorithm behaves as a single block cipher
    with a large plaintext input and ciphertext output, but uses a narrow block cipher
    [in this case Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)] internally. These encryption
    modes are oriented toward random access storage devices that do not provide authentication,
    but need to reduce the granularity of a potential attack.
