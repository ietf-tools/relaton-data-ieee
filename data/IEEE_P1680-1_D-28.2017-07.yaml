abstract:
- content: A clear and consistent set of environmental and social responsibility performance
    criteria for the design of computers (including notebook computers, desktop computers,
    integrated desktop computers, portable all-in-one computers, slates/tablets, small-scale
    servers, thin clients and workstations) and displays (including monitors and signage
    displays) is established, providing an opportunity for manufacturers to secure
    market recognition for their efforts. This standard is also intended to provide
    a tool for government, institutional, corporate, and consumer purchasers to identify
    products that demonstrate environmental and social responsibility leadership.
    This standard is intended to be updated and revised on a periodic basis 8 to continue
    to set a higher performance standard for leadership products.
