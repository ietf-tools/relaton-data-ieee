abstract:
- content: 'POSIX.1-2008 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1 -2008 and The Open Group
    Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7. POSIX. 1-2008 defines a standard
    operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or
    "shell"), and common utility programs to support applications portability at the
    source code level. POSIX. 1-2008 is intended to be used by both application developers
    and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated
    volume): [1]General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this
    standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are
    included in the Base Definitions volume. [2] Definitions for system service functions
    and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language,
    function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are
    included in the System Interfaces volume. [3] Definitions for a standard source
    code-level interface to command interpretation services (a "shell") and common
    utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities
    volume. [4] Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document
    structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of POSIX.
    1-2008 and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers,
    is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume. The following areas are outside
    the scope of POSIX. 1-2008: Graphics interfaces Database management system interfaces
    Record I/O considerations Object or binary code portability System configuration
    and resource availability. POSIX. 1-2008 describes the external characteristics
    and facilities that are of importance to application developers, rather than the
    internal construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special
    emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide
    variety of commercial applications.'

- content: This standard is simultaneously ISO/IEC 9945, IEEE Std 1003.1, and forms
    the core of the Single Unix Specification, Version 3. This 2004 edition includes
    IEEE Std 1003.1-2001/Cor 1-2002 and IEEE Std 1003.1-2001/Cor 2-2004 incorporated
    into IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (the base document). The two Corrigenda address problems
    discovered since the approval of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. These changes are mainly
    due to resolving integration issues raised by the merger of the base documents
    that were incorporated into the IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, which is the single common
    revision to IEEE Std 1003.1-1996, IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996, ISO/IEC
    9945-2:1993, and the Base Specifications of The Open Group Single UNIX&#174; Specification,
    Version 2.
