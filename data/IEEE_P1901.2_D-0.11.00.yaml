abstract:
- content: A worldwide standard for narrow band power line communications via AC,
    DC, and non-energized electric power lines using frequencies below 500 kHz. Data
    rates of up to 500 kbps are supported. The field-of-use includes Smart Grid applications.
    Coexistence mechanisms that can be used by other PLC technologies operating below
    500 kHz are also included. These coexistence mechanisms may be used separately
    from the rest of the standard.
