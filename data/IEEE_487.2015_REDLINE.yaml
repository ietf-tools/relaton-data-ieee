abstract:
  content: General considerations are presented for the electrical protection of telecommunications
    facilities serving electric supply locations. This standard contains material
    that is common to the IEEE 487(TM) family of standards (i.e., dot-series) including
    fundamental protection theory; basic electrical protection philosophy, concepts,
    and designs; protection apparatus; service types; reliability; service performance
    objective (SPO) classifications; and transmission considerations. In general,
    special protective measures, handling procedures, and administrative procedures
    are necessary to provide electrical protection against damage to telecommunications
    facilities and equipment, maintain reliability of service, and ensure the safety
    of personnel.
