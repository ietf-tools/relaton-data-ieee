abstract:
- content: Guidance for the application of ac high-voltage circuit breakers switching
    capacitive currents is provided. The general theory of capacitive current switching
    and the notions of restrike, reignition, and nonsustained disruptive discharge
    (NSDD) are addressed in the application guide. Voltage factors used for single-phase
    testing as a substitute for three-phase testing are explained. The application
    of circuit breakers for different network conditions and different capacitive
    loads (capacitor banks, cables, transmission lines, and filter banks) is discussed.
