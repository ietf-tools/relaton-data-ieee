abstract:
  content: Physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of a broadband powerline
    communication technology called flexible channel wavelet PHY/MAC (FCW) for Internet
    of Things applications (IoTPLC) based on wavelet orthogonal frequency division
    multiplexing (wavelet OFDM) are specified in this amendment. Modes for operations
    in different channels (frequency bands) with different values of carrier spacing
    are defined.
