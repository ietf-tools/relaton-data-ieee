abstract:
- content: Described in this recommended practice are methods for estimating the costs
    of industrial and commercial power systems, both new and those undergoing expansion
    or modernization. This recommended practice is restricted to the development of
    the relative capital cost of industrial and commercial power distribution systems.
    While this document briefly points out considerations related to total cost or
    true cost, as well as some technical considerations, other standards and references
    should be referred to for a thorough analysis of these aspects of power distribution
    systems. This recommended practice is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented
    engineer with limited experience in this area. It can also be an aid to all engineers
    responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
