abstract:
- content: The purpose of the IEEE standard presented is to provide uniform, minimum
    acceptable requirements for preparation and content of software quality assurance
    plans (SQAPs). In considering adoption of this standard, regulatory bodies should
    be aware that specific application of this standard may already be covered by
    one or more IEEE or ANSI standards documents relating to quality assurance, definitions,
    or other matters. This standard applies to the development and maintenance of
    critical software. For non-critical software, or for software already developed,
    a subset of the requirements of this standard may be applied. The existence of
    this standard should not be construed to prohibit additional content in a SQAP.
    An assessment should be made for the specific software item to assure adequacy
    of coverage. Where this standard is invoked for an organization or project engaged
    in producting several software items, the applicability of the standard should
    be specified for each of the software items.<<ETX>>
