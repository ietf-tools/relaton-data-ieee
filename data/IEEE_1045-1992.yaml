abstract:
- content: A consistent way to measure the elements that go into computing software
    productivity is defined. Software productivity metrics terminology are given to
    ensure an understanding of measurement data for both source code and document
    production. Although this IEEE standard prescribes measurements to characterize
    the software process, it does not establish software productivity norms, nor does
    it recommend productivity measurements as a method to evaluate software projects
    or software developers. This standard does not measure the quality of software.
    This standard does not claim to improve productivity, only to measure it. The
    goal of this standard is for a better understanding of the software process, which
    may lend insight to improving it.<<ETX>>
