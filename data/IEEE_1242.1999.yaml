abstract:
- content: Information on the specification and selection of power, control, and special-purposecable,
    as typically used in petroleum, chemical, and similar plants, is provided in this
    guide. Materials, design, testing, and applications are addressed. More recent
    developments, such as strandfilling, low-smoke, zero-halogen materials, and chemical-moisture
    barriers have been included.
