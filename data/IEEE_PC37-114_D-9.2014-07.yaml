abstract:
- content: 'Electrical faults on transmission and distribution lines are detected
    and isolated by system protective devices. Once the fault has been cleared, outage
    times can be reduced if the location of the fault can be determined more quickly.
    This guide outlines the techniques and application considerations for determining
    the location of a fault on AC transmission and distribution lines. The document
    reviews traditional approaches and the primary measurement techniques used in
    modern devices: one-terminal and two-terminal impedance-based methods and traveling
    wave methods. Application considerations include: two- and three-terminal lines,
    series-compensated lines, parallel lines, untransposed lines, underground cables,
    fault resistance effects, and other power system conditions, including those unique
    to distribution systems.'
