abstract:
- content: This standard pertains to computer-type pulse transformers. These pulse
    transformers are characterized by their use of a square loop core material as
    defined below with normal operation into the saturation flux density regions and
    with typical operation using a specifically defined current input pulse. These
    transformers exploit the memory characteristic of square-loop core material that
    makes the output pulse dependent upon the immediate history of the core flux.
    This type of transformer is used in shift registers, memory across switches, memory
    readout circuits, transformer logic matrices, and other storage-type devices.
    It is not the purpose of this standard to include large-scale memories. Wherever
    numerical requirements are indicated, they may be considered as recommended values.
    Appendix I contains a core analysis, transformer equivalent circuit, and definitions
    of associated terms. Appendix II contains definitions pertaining mainly to characteristic
    testing of computer-type pulse transformers.
