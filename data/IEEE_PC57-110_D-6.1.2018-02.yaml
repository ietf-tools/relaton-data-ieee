abstract:
- content: Provided in this recommended practice are calculation methods for conservatively
    evaluating the feasibility for an existing installed dry-type or liquid immersed
    transformer, to supply nonsinusoidal load currents as a portion of the total load.
    Also provided is necessary application information to assist in properly specifying
    a new transformer expected to carry a load, a portion of which is composed of
    nonsinusoidal load currents. A number of examples illustrating these methods and
    calculations are presented. Reference annexes provide a comparison of the document
    calculations to calculations found in other industry standards. Suggested temperature
    rise calculation methods are detailed for reference purposes.
