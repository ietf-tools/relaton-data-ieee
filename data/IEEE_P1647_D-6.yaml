abstract:
- content: The scope of this standard is the definition of the e functional verification
    language. This standard aims to serve as an authoritative source for the definition
    of (a) syntax and semantics of e language constructs (b) the e language interaction
    with standard simulation languages (c) e language libraries This revision extends
    the standard to cover novel verification-related features.
