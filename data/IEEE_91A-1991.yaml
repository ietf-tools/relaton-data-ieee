abstract:
- content: 'The following topics were dealt with: IEEE Std 91a-1991 presents graphic
    symbols for representing logic functions or physical devices capable of carrying
    out logic functions. It gives descriptions of logic functions, the graphic representation
    of these functions, and examples of their applications. The symbols are presented
    in the context of electrical applications, but most may also be applied to nonelectrical
    systems (for example, pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical). The supplement provides
    additional internationally approved graphic symbols and makes corrections as needed
    to IEEE Std 91-1984.<<ETX>>'
