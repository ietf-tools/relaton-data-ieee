abstract:
- content: Superseded. Gas-tube surge-protective devices for application on systems
    with voltages 1000 V rms or 1200 V dc are covered. These protective devices are
    designed to limit voltage surges on balanced or unbalanced communication circuits
    and on power circuits operating from dc to 420 Hz. Test criteria for determining
    the electrical characteristics of these devices are provided.
