abstract:
- content: This standard describes heterogeneous networks convergence and scalability,
    specifies the requirements of networks convergence, extends the system architecture
    defined in IEEE 1888 Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network with two new IEEE
    1888 components, i.e., Reconfigurable Resolution Server (RRS) and Intelligent
    Application Resolver (IAR), generalizes primitive data type expressions and explicit
    field-bus data type management in IEEE 1888 system. This standard enables IEEE
    1888 system to interoperate with heterogeneous access networks efficiently and
    improves the efficiency, flexibility, scalability and manageability of IEEE 1888
    system
