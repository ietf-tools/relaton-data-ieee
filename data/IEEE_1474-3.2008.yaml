abstract:
- content: This recommended practice for communications-based train control (CBTC)
    system design and functional allocations builds on IEEE Std 1474.1 by decomposing
    each identified automatic train protection, automatic train operation and automatic
    train supervision function to a level where each subfunction can be allocated
    to one of the CBTC subsystems.
