abstract:
- content: Directions for establishing type tests that may be used in qualifying Class
    1E electric cables, field splices, and other connections for service in nuclear
    power generating stations are provided. Though intended primarily for cable for
    field installation, this guide may also be used for the qualification of internal
    wiring of manufactured devices. It does not cover cables for service within the
    reactor vessel.
