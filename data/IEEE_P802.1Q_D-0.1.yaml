abstract:
- content: This standard specifies how the MAC Service is supported by Virtual Bridged
    Local Area Networks, the principles of operation of those networks, and the operation
    of VLAN-aware Bridges, including management, protocols, and algorithms. The amendments
    that were specified in IEEE Std 802.1AD enable a service provider to use the architecture
    and protocols defined in this standard to offer the equivalent of separate LANs,
    Bridged Local Area Networks, or Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks to a number
    of customers, while requiring no cooperation between the customers, and minimal
    cooperation between each customer and the service provider.
