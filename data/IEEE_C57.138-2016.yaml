abstract:
- content: General test procedures for performing routine quality control tests that
    are suitable for high-volume, production line testing are included in this recommended
    practice. Transformer connections, test methods, circuit configurations, and failure
    detection methods are addressed. This recommended practice covers liquid-immersed,
    single- and three-phase distribution transformers.
