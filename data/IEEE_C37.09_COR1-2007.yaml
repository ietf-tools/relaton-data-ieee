abstract:
- content: 'This corrigendum corrects technical and other non-editorial errors made
    during the preparation of IEEE Std C37.09-1999 latest version, second printing
    19 December 2005, which covers test procedures for all high-voltage circuit breakers
    rated over 1000 VAC. This text also includes corrections to the errata dated 19
    December 2005, which adjusts Figure 17 on page 62 of the main text (under 7.2).
    As of the printing of this corrigendum, IEEE Std C37.09-1999 includes all of the
    following: IEEE Std C37.09-1999 latest version, second printing 19 December 2005;
    Errata to IEEE Std C37.09-1999 (edited 18 April 2007), which corrects typographical
    and editorial errors to the standard (note that these alterations have been made
    to the most current electronic version of the standard which is available online
    http://shop.ieee.org/ieeestore/); IEEE Std C37.09a-2005, amendment to IEEE Std
    C37.09-1999, which adds additional content to the standard; and this corrigendum,
    IEEE Std C37.09-1999/Cor 1-2007, which makes technical corrections to both the
    original IEEE Std C37.09-1999 and the subsequently published errata.'
