abstract:
- content: Jackets furnish mechanical protection for cables during installation and
    heat cycling. Jackets retard the ingress of water and earth chemicals into the
    underlying core. Jackets over metallic shields, sheaths and concentric neutral
    wires also provide protection against corrosion.
