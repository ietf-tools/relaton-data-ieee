abstract:
- content: The areas of recommended knowledge for installers and maintainers of stationarybatteries
    and related systems, to the extent that they affect the battery, are defined in
    this recommended practice. Design of the dc system and sizing of the dc battery
    charger(s) are beyond the scope of this document. Only lead-acid and nickel-cadmium
    battery technologies are covered in this recommended practice. An outline (not
    necessarily in training order) of the items that should be covered by training
    programs for stationary battery installation and maintenance personnel is provided.
    Certifying trained personnel and providing its own battery technician training
    programs will not be performed by IEEE.
