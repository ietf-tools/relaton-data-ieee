abstract:
- content: This amendment defines modifications to both the 802.11 physical layers
    (PHY) and the 802.11 Medium Access Control Layer (MAC) so that modes of operation
    can be enabled that are capable of much higher throughputs, with a maximum throughput
    of at least 100 Mb/s, as measured at the MAC data service access point (SAP).
