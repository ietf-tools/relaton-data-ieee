- content: 'Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of carbon
    steel pole mounted enclosures containing apparatus energized in excess of 600
    volts, typically located out of reach of the general public, including, but not
    limited to, the following types of equipment enclosures: polemounted distribution
    transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted regulators, pole-mounted metering
    equipment, pole-mounted reclosers, and pole-mounted switchgear are covered.'
