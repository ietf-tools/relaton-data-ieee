abstract:
- content: A definition of the requirements placed upon providers of a POSIX Conformance
    Test Suite for the POSIX.2 standard (ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993, IEEE/ANSI Std. 1003.2-1992)
    is provided. These requirements consist of a list of assertions defining those
    aspects of POSIX.2 that are to be tested and the associated test methods that
    are to be used in performing those tests. This standard is primarily aimed at
    test suite providers but it also defines to POSIX.2 implementors those aspects
    of the standard that will be verified by a conformance test suite.
