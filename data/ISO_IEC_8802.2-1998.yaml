abstract:
- content: This standard is part of a family of standards for local area networks
    (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs) that deals with the physical and
    data link layers as defined by the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference
    Model. The functions, features, protocol, and services of the Logical Link Control
    (LLC) sublayer, which constitutes the top sublayer in the data link layer of the
    ISO/IEC 8802 LAN protocol, are described. The services required of, or by, the
    LLC sublayer at the logical interfaces with the network layer, the medium access
    control (MAC) sublayer, and the LLC sublayer management function are specified.
    The protocol data unit (PDU) structure for data communication systems is defined
    using bit-oriented procedures, as are three types of operation for data communication
    between service access points. In the first type of operation, PDUs are exchanged
    between LLCs without the need for the establishment of a data link connection.
    In the second type of operation, a data link connection is established between
    two LLCs prior to any exchange of information-bearing PDUs. In the third type
    of operation, PDUs are exchanged between LLCs without the need for the establishment
    of a data link connection, but stations are permitted to both send data and request
    the return of data simultaneously.
