abstract:
- content: These recommendations apply to thyristor ac power controllers that are
    low voltage, power elctronic, industrial class equipment for the control or switching
    of ac power. Switching, multicycle control and phase control are included. Cycloconverters
    are excluded. Examples of application include, but are not limited to, industrial
    oven controls, static motor starters, static relays, etc. This standard is intended
    to be used in conjunction with IEC Pub 146 (1973) [2] .l Reference is made to
    the appropriate section of IEC Pub 146 (1973) [2] where required.
