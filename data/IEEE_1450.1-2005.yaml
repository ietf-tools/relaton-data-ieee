abstract:
- content: Replaced by IEC 62526 Ed. 1 (2007-11. Standard Test Interface Language
    (STIL) provides an interface between digital test generation tools and test equipment.
    Extensions to the test interface language (contained in this standard) are defined
    that (1) facilitate the use of the language in the design environment and (2)
    facilitate the use of the language for large designs encompassing subdesigns with
    reusable patterns.
