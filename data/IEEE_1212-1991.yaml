abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 1212-2001 A common bus architecture (which includes
    functional components&#8212;modules, nodes, and units&#8212;and their address
    space, transaction set, CSRs, and configuration information) suitable for both
    parallel and serial buses is provided in this standard. Bus bridges are enabled
    by the architecture, but their details are beyond its scope. Configuration information
    is self-administered by vendors and organizations based upon IEEE Registration
    Authority company_id.
