abstract:
- content: Open system interfaces for high power electronics equipment used in zonal
    electrical distribution systems rated above 100 kW are identified in this standard.
    The required power, monitoring, information exchange, control, and protection
    interfaces are based on technological maturity, accepted practices, and allowances
    for future technology insertions. Also, rigorous assessment mechanisms, interface
    control management, and proactive conformance testing that shall be used to verify
    and validate open systems to enable plug-and-play operability independently of
    the components’ origin are defined. Airports, hospitals, major data processing
    centers (especially those using uninterruptible power supply), broadcast systems,
    and maritime vessels and platforms are applications covered by this standard.
    Existing terrestrial utility power systems that do not yet contain the electronic
    power interfaces and high-speed communication networks that are essential to use
    this standard shall be upgraded by its application.
