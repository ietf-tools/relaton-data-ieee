abstract:
- content: The in-service visual inspection, application, care, maintenance, and electrical
    and mechanical testing of insulating flexible slings, including core, insulating
    sheath, and attachments for use during live line work on voltages up to 1000 kV
    alternating current (AC) and ±800 kV direct current (DC) is provided in this guide.
    Testing pertains only to electrical and mechanical tests that may be performed
    periodically to check if there is any reduction in the electrical performance,
    mechanical performance, and both (combined) electrical and mechanical performance
    of the insulating flexible sling.
