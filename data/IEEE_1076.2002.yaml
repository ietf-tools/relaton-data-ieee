  content: 'Replaced by 61691-1-1 Dual-logo document. Revision of the IEEE Std 1076,
    2000 Edition Abstract: VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is defined.
    VHDL is a formal notation intended for use in all phases of the creation of electronic
    systems. Because it is both machine readable and human readable, it supports the
    development, verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware designs; the communication
    of hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification, and procurement of
    hardware. Its primary audiences are the implementors of tools supporting the language
    and the advanced users of the language.'
