abstract:
- content: Communications protocols to be used for inter-unit and intra-unit serial
    data communications between subsystems aboard passenger trains are defined by
    this standard. Minimum acceptable parameters for a network that can simultaneously
    handle monitoring and control traffic from multiple systems are set forth. While
    the network is not vital, it is intended to be capable of carrying vital messages.
