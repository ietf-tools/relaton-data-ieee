abstract:
- content: The existing low-energy critical infrastructure monitoring (LECIM) frequency
    shift keying (FSK) physical layer of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2020 is extended to be
    more robust in the presence of interference and achieve higher link budgets for
    applications in low power wide area networks (LPWAN). Lower symbol rates and a
    split mode with low-rate forward error correction (FEC) codes are introduced to
    achieve this goal.
