abstract:
- content: Standard requirements for all types of electrical control circuits for
    ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V are given. Any type of power-operated
    mechanism and both ac and dc control power are applicable for this standard. Only
    basic control elements of the circuit breaker, including reclosing where required,
    are included in this standard. Devices or circuits for protective relaying, special
    interlocking, and so forth are not included.
