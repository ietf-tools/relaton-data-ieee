abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C95.1-2005 This Amendment will clarify the standard
    by specifically defining additional portions of the human body, e.g., the outer
    ear (pinna), as extremities subject to similar specific absorption rate (SAR)
    limits as extremities already defined, e.g., hands, feet, wrist and ankles
