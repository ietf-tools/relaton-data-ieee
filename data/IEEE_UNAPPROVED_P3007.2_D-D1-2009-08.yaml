abstract:
- content: IEEE¿s Industrial Applications Society has determined a need for reorganizing
    the IEEE¿s Color Books Series, 13 books that currently cover various topics that
    fall under the purview of the Industrial and Commercial Power Industry. This recommended
    practice covers the maintenance of industrial and commercial power systems. It
    covers the fundamentals of electrical equipment maintenance, how to develop successful
    maintenance strategies, and the common testing methods used as part of an electrical
    equipment maintenance program.
