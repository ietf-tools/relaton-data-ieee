abstract:
- content: The rise in the incidence of global pandemics and climate catastrophes
    demonstrates that the demand for healthcare services is stretched beyond what
    services can be effectively provided. Even with increased healthcare spending
    in recent years in the United States and worldwide, access to healthcare resources
    has declined for many. To improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare
    solutions to meet this increasing demand and increase patient self-efficacy, connected
    healthcare solutions, including hospital-at-home, are being introduced. Many limitations
    exist for hospital-at-home models, including policy gaps, technological gaps,
    and issues patients face specific to their health outcomes. To overcome these
    limitations, a transdisciplinary framework for hospital-at-home is presented in
    this white paper. Barriers to the implementation of this framework are discussed,
    including healthcare worker burnout and the impact on the social determinants
    of health. Potential extensions to the transdisciplinary framework beyond hospital-at-home
    are also presented.
