abstract:
- content: There is a critical need to identify electronic health records without
    compromising the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. This white paper
    discusses important possible parameters associated with electronic health records
    that could be used for this identification. The core objective of this white paper
    is to set a stage for the development of IEEE standards associated with the identification
    of electronic health records, thereby discussing the feasibility and potential
    stakeholders for such standards.
