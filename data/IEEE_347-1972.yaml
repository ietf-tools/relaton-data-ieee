abstract:
- content: 'The knowledge of the recorded signal amplitude on a magnetic record (which
    may be in the form of a tape, a disc, o&#x03C4; a perforated film) has several
    practical uses: (1) for determining and standardizing references for the levels
    of audio programs on these magnetic records; (2) for specifying the recording-performance
    properties of magnetic media (for example, the distortion versus flux, etc); and
    (3) for measuring and specifying the sensitivity of reproducing heads (and also,
    by reciprocity, recording heads). The quantity for specifying the recorded signal
    is the short-circuit magnetic flux, sometimes simply shortened to flux. Several
    possible methods exist for measuring tape flux, but the measurement given here
    involves only the use of a calibrated ring-core head which is described in the
    reference of the standard. Note that the present standard measurement is only
    for "medium wavelengths". A further standard method for measuring short-circuit
    flux at long wavelengths and at short wavelengths - that is, the "frequency response"
    of the flux on a magnetic record - is under consideration. The technique utilizing
    a calibrated ring-core head to measure directly the flux at medium wavelengths
    is superior to magnetometer methods and to "single turn head" methods which have
    been used in the past because the head is easily manufactured using highly perfected
    commercial methods. The transducer (head) is commercially available to any laboratory
    at a reasonable cost; it is easily used, and requires no specialized auxiliary
    equipment. A further advantage of this method over magnetometer methods is the
    elimination of the errors inherent in making the "transfer" recording which is
    necessary for a magnetometer measurement. This standard represents the joint efforts
    of the Recording and Reproducing Standards Subcommittee of the Standards Committee
    of IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics and the Sound Engineering Committee
    of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. It was originally prepared
    by an SMPTE Ad Hoc Committee as a method of measurement of flux on magnetic sound
    tracks used in motion-picture films, and was later modified for measurement of
    recorded flux in any form of magnetic sound record at medium wavelengths. This
    standard specifies a method of measuring the recorded flux per unit width of a
    magnetically recorded test signal at medium wavelengths for all magnetic sound
    record formats. It also specifies the equipment needed to implement this method.'
