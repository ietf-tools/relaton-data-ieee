abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of the communication
    between personal strength fitness devices and managers (e.g. cell phones, personal
    computes, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that enables
    plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions of existing
    standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and information models. It specifies
    the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments
    restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This
    standard defines a common core of communication functionality for personal telehealth
    strength fitness devices. In this context, strength fitness devices are being
    used broadly to cover strength fitness devices that measure musculo-skeletal strength
    conditioning activities.
