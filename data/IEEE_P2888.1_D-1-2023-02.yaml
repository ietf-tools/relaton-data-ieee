abstract:
- content: 'This standard defines the vocabulary, data formats, and APIs for acquiring
    information from sensors, enabling communication between the cyber world and the
    physical world, including: -- data formats for interfacing sensor data defining
    a root schema with individual sensor data, -- data formats for recognizing sensor
    capabilities defining a root schema with individual sensor capabilities, -- data
    formats for common data types, and -- application programming interfaces to transmit
    sensor and its capability data between cyber and physical worlds.'
