abstract:
- content: The procedures for testing the compliance of a wide variety of unlicensed
    wireless transmitters (also called intentional radiators and license-exempt transmitters)
    including, but not limited to, remote control and security unlicensed wireless
    devices, frequency hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum devices, anti-pilferage
    devices, cordless telephones, medical unlicensed wireless devices, Unlicensed
    National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) devices, intrusion detectors, unlicensed
    wireless devices operating on frequencies below 30 MHz, automatic vehicle identification
    systems, and other unlicensed wireless devices authorized by a radio regulatory
    authority are covered in this standard. Excluded by this standard are test procedures
    for unlicensed wireless devices already covered in other published standards (e.g.,
    Unlicensed Personal Communication Services (UPCS) devices). Subclause 6.2.2 is
    addressed in this corrigendum, such that the requirement to calibrate the LISN
    with the extension cord is removed and Equation (L.1) has been corrected.
