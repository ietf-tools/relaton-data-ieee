abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2005. A common format for data files and exchange medium used
    for the interchange of various types of fault, test, or simulation data for electrical
    power systems is defined. Sources of transient data are described, and the case
    of diskettes as an exchange medium is recommended. Issues of sampling rates, filters,
    and sample rate conversions for transient data being exchanged are discussed.
    Files for data exchange are specified, as is the organization of the data. A sample
    file is given.
