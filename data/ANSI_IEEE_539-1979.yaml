abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE 539-1990. IEEE Standard Definitions of Terms Relating
    to Corona and Field Effects of Overhead Power Lines, defines terms related to
    the areas of corona and the electromagnetic environment of overhead power lines.
    Its scope is to define the most widely used terms specific to or associated with
    overhead power-line corona and fields. This includes terms used in electric and
    magnetic fields, ions, radio frequency propagation, electromagnetic signals and
    noise, audible noise, coupled voltages and current, shock and perception, weather
    and related statistical terms, and measurements and measuring devices.
