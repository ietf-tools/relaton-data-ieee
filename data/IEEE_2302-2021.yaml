abstract:
- content: A functional model for federation based on the NIST Cloud Federation Reference
    Architecture is defined in this standard. This model allows a range of deployment
    topologies and governance. As a general federation model, it can be applied to
    many application domains using different implementation approaches. As such, it
    includes cloud-to-cloud federation and interoperability.
