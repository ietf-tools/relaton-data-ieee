abstract:
- content: The Natural Language Processing (NLP) services using machine learning have
    rich applications in solving various tasks, and have been widely deployed and
    used, usually accessible by API calls. The robustness of the NLP services is challenged
    by various well-known general corruptions and adversarial attacks. Examples of
    general corruptions include inadvertent or random deletion, addition, or repetition
    of characters or words. Adversarial attacks generate adversarial characters, words
    or sentence samples causing the models underpinning the NLP services to produce
    incorrect results. This standard proposes a method for quantitatively evaluating
    the robustness the NLP services. Under the method, different cases the evaluation
    needs to perform against are specified. Robustness metrics and their calculation
    are defined. With the standard, the service stakeholders including the service
    developer, service providers, and service users can develop understanding of the
    robustness of the services. The evaluation can be performed during various phases
    in the life cycle of the NLP services, the testing phase, in the validation phase,
    after deployment, etc.
