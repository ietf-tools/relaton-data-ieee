abstract:
- content: 'The requirements for synchronous machines with excitation windings are
    covered by three American National Standards as follows: American National Standard
    General Requirements for Synchronous Machines, C50.10-1977. American National
    Standard Requirements for Cylindrical Rotor Synchronous Generators, C50.13-1977.
    American National Standard Requirements for Combustion Gas Turbine Driven Synchronous
    Generators, C50.14-1977. This standard contains general requirements and definitions
    applicable to all types of 60 Hz synchronous machines except fractional horsepower
    motors. Specific requirements for cylindrical rotor synchronous generators and
    combustion gas turbine driven synchronous generators will be found in American
    National Standards C50.13-1977 and C50.14-1977.'
