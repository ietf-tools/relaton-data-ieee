abstract:
- content: This Next Generation Service Overlay Network (NGSON) standard describes
    a framework of Internet Protocol(IP)-based service overlay networks and specifies
    context-aware (e.g., such as required Quality of Service (QoS) level, type of
    service such as real-time vs. data, nature of data stream such as Iframe vs. B-frame,
    and type of terminal such as TV monitor vs. personal digital assistant), dynamically
    adaptive (e.g., using locally derived information to discover, organize, and maintain
    traffic flows in the network within a local area network), and self-organizing
    networking capabilities (e.g., developing network structures based on the needs
    of the customers and the capabilities of existing network structures), including
    advanced routing and forwarding schemes, and that are independent of underlying
    networks. The NGSON architecture provides advanced service- and transport-related
    functions to support contextaware, dynamically adaptive, and self-organizing networks.
    This standard specifies a functional architecture for NGSON. The functional architecture
    consists of a set of functional entities (FEs), their functions, reference points
    and information flows to illustrate service interaction and media delivery among
    FEs and external components. NGSON may operate with different underlying networks
    such as IMS, NGN, P2P overlay or Web to transmit NGSON signaling messages and/or
    media among its users and services. Specifications of underlying networks are
    outside scope of this standard.
