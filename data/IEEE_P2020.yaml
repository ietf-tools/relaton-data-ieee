abstract:
- content: The IEEE-SA P2020 working group on automotive imaging standards was established
    in order to address the considerable ambiguity in measurement of image quality
    of automotive imaging systems, both human and computer vision based. This white
    paper outlines the goals, achievements, rationale and plans of the subgroup, which
    has started to work on development of a new standard. Image quality plays a crucial
    role for both automotive viewing and automotive computer vision applications and
    today’s image evaluation approaches do not necessarily meet the needs of such
    applications. Currently theree is not a consistent approach within the industry
    to measure automotive image quality. The IEEE P2020 working group is attempting
    to remedy these deficiencies by connecting people in the field, identifying gaps
    in existing standards, and working to address these by creating a coherent set
    of key performance indicators by which camera systems and components may be evaluated
    in a manner consistent with their intended use. This white paper provides an overview
    of current activities including initial gap analysis and details of what may be
    expected from the full standard when published.
