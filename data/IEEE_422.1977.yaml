abstract:
- content: This document has been developed as a guide for the design and installation
    of wire and cable systems in generating stations with the objective of minimizing
    failures and their consequences. This guide is not intended for use in design
    considerations of wire and cable systems in switchyards or substations. Although
    the function of this document is a design guide, some of the problem solutions
    are presented in the wording of recommended practices. Users of the guide should
    be aware that the recommendations offered do not represent the only acceptable
    practices available for solution of the problems. They do represent principles
    and methods which are consistent with the goals of this guide.
