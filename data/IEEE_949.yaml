abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to define a format for the transmission
    of files and their attributes between computer systems independent of the medium
    of transmission. It is intended that any information medium capable of representing
    a consecutive sequence of 8-bit bytes should be adaptable to the format specified
    in this standard. The format is designed to facilitate the human interface to
    file selection from transmissions by foreign systems.<<ETX>>
