abstract:
- content: 'This recommended practice provides Instrument Description templates, compliant
    with IEEE 1671.2, that providers of synthetic instruments should use to describe
    waveform generators, digitizers, external local oscillators, and up and down converter.
    Instrument Description templates, compliant with IEEE Std 1671.2-2012, that providers
    of synthetic instruments should use to describe waveform generators, digitizers,
    external local oscillators, and up and down converters are provided in this recommended
    practice. These synthetic instruments may be integrated in an automatic test system
    (ATS) that is to be used to test and diagnose a unit under test (UUT). '
