abstract:
- content: Foundations for transmission structures are subjected to unique loading
    conditions in which a high portion of the load is transitory and involves high
    uplift forces or high overturning moments with little vertical loading. Information
    concerning the design of foundations subjected to such loading conditions has
    not been readily available to designers in a single document. Thus, the objective
    of this guide is to provide in a single source available information on design
    methods for foundation design engineers. The information contained in this guide
    covers the modes of foundation loads for various types of transmission structures;
    the scope of subsurface investigations; alternate methods for designing spread
    foundations, drilled shafts, pile foundations, and anchors; and procedures for
    conducting load tests.
