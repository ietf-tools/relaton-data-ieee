abstract:
- content: AI-ESTATE is a set of specifications for data interchange and for standard
    services for the test and diagnostic environment. The purpose of AI-ESTATE is
    to standardize interfaces between functional elements of an intelligent diagnostic
    reasoner and representations of diagnostic knowledge and data for use by such
    diagnostic reasoners. Formal information models are defined to form the basis
    for a format to facilitate exchange of persistent diagnostic information between
    two reasoners, and also to provide a formal typing system for diagnostic services.
    This standard then defines the services to manipulate diagnostic information and
    to control a diagnostic reasoner.
