abstract:
- content: This standard defines test methods and performance criteria for plug-in
    (portable) Multiservice (Multiport) Surge Protective Devices, MSPDs, intended
    to protect equipment connected to one or more metallic conductive telecommunication
    line(s) and a 120/240 V single phase AC Power Service, with the neutral grounded
    at the service equipment. Performance testing covers three areas; the AC power
    SPD section, the telecommunication SPD section and the MSPD as whole. Essential
    MSPD performance characteristics are the reduction of surge current in the equipment
    ground loops and surge coupling between the individual SPD sections.
