abstract:
- content: Criteria for the design of an integrated security system for nuclear power
    generating stations are provided in this standard. Requirements are included for
    the overall system, interfaces, subsystems, and individual electrical and electronic
    equipment. This standard addresses equipment for security-related detection, surveillance,
    access control, communication, data acquisition, and threat assessment.
