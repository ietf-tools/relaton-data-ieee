abstract:
- content: General requirements, functional and technical performance requirements,
    test requirements, labeling requirements, packaging, transportation and storage
    requirements, supply integrity requirements, and quality assurance requirements
    for hybrid high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission control and protection
    equipment are provided in this guide. This guide could be applied to the control
    and protection equipment of parallel two-terminal or multiterminal hybrid dc transmission
    system with a dc voltage level of ±110 kV and above, including line-commutated
    converter (LCC) and voltage-source converter (VSC).
