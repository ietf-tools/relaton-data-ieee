abstract:
- content: The architecture, abstraction layers, interfaces, and metadata requirements
    for spectrum characterization and occupancy sensing (SCOS) systems are specified
    in this standard. This standard also defines performance parameters, units, and
    measures. This SCOS system comprises one or more semi-autonomous spectrum sensors,
    which scan electromagnetic spectrum, digitize it, and perform processing, transmitting
    the resultant data with appropriate metadata to a central storage and processing
    system.
