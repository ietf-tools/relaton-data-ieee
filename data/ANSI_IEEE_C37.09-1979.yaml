abstract:
- content: 'The various tests that are made on AC high-voltage circuit breakers are
    summarized. Accepted methods used in making the tests are described, and the tests
    that will demonstrate ratings under ANSI/IEEE standards are specified. The following
    categories of tests are considered: design tests, production tests, tests after
    delivery, field tests, and conformance tests.'
