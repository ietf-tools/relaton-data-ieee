abstract:
- content: This Amendment to the IEEE Std 1900.6TM adds procedures, protocols and
    message format specifications for the exchange of sensing related data, control
    data and configuration data between spectrum sensors and their clients. In addition,
    it adds specifications for the exchange of sensing related and other relevant
    data and specifies related interfaces between the data archive and other data
    sources
