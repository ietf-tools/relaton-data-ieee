abstract:
- content: Surge protectors for application on multiconductor balanced or unbalanced
    information and communications technology (ICT) circuits and smart grid data circuits
    are addressed in this standard. These surge protectors are designed to limit voltage
    surges, current surges, or both. The surge protectors covered are generally multiple-component
    series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear elements, packaged or organized
    for the purpose of limiting voltage, current, or both. The methods of testing
    and criteria (where appropriate) for the characteristics and ratings of surge
    protectors used in ICT circuits and smart grid data circuits are also described
    in this standard. Packaged single gas tube, air gap, varistor, or avalanche junction
    surge-protective components are not covered by this standard, but rather are covered
    by IEEE Std C62.31(TM), IEEE Std C62.32(TM), IEEE Std C62.33(TM), and IEEE Std
    C62.35(TM), respectively. Specifically excluded from this standard are test methods
    for low-voltage power circuit applications. For protection of wire-line communication
    facilities under the specialized conditions found at power stations, consult IEEE
    Std 487(TM).
