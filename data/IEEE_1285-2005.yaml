abstract:
- content: This document specifies a scalable interface between mass-storage devices
    and controlling hard-ware/software. The interface has been optimized for low-latency
    interconnects, assuming that the proces-sor/controller and the storage device
    can often be co-located on the same printed-circuit board. The interface can also
    be used with longer-distance bus-like interconnects, including (but not limited
    to) IEEE Std 1394-1995 Serial Bus and IEEE Std 1596-1992 Scalable Coherent Interface.
