abstract:
- content: This guide describes methods to protect a power system from faults that
    are not cleared because of failure of a power circuit breaker to operate or interrupt
    when called upon by a protective relay. The intent is to give the reader a guide
    in how to detect that a breaker has failed to clear a fault, and how to electrically
    isolate the fault after the breaker has failed to clear the fault. Additionally,
    schemes which provide primary protection of the power system from performance
    failures of the power circuit breaker other than fault clearing failures such
    as failure to operate, either tripping or closing, manual or automatic, are also
    described. Such schemes, when applied, are typically integrated as a part of the
    overall break
