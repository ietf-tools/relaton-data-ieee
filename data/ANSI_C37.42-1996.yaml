abstract:
- content: This standard is one of a series of complementary standards covering various
    types of high-voltage fuses and switches, arranged so that certain standards apply
    to all devices while other standards provide additional specifications for a particular
    device. For any device, ANSI/IEEE C37.40-1993, ANSI/IEEE C37.41-1994, plus the
    additional standard covering that device, constitute a complete standard for the
    device. In addition, ANSI/IEEE C37.48-1987 (R1992) is an application, operation,
    and maintenance guide for all the devices.
