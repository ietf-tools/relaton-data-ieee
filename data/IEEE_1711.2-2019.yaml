abstract:
- content: A cryptographic protocol to provide integrity with optional confidentiality
    for cyber security of substation serial links is defined in this standard. It
    does not address specific applications or hardware implementations and is independent
    of the underlying communications protocol.The elevated concern of cyber security
    throughout the power industry has created a need to protect communications to
    and from substations. This standard defines a cryptographic protocol known as
    Secure SCADA Communications Protocol (SSCP) that protects the integrity and, optionally,
    the confidentiality of asynchronous serial communications typically used by control
    system equipment. SSCP is primarily intended to protect serial SCADA communications,
    but can be applied to other serial communications, such as the maintenance ports
    of intelligent electronic devices. SSCP is independent of the underlying communications
    link and protocol (e.g., Modbus, DNP3, IEC 60870- 5), and is appropriate for serial
    communications over leased lines, dial-up lines, multi-drop links, radio, power
    line carrier, fiber optic, etc. SSCP is suitable for implementation in new equipment
    or for deployment in bump-in-the-wire devices retrofitting protection to existing
    systems.
