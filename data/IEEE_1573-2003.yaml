abstract:
- content: A technical basis for implementation of electronic power subsystems is
    provided in this recommended practice. It is intended for electronic systems engineers
    and integrators, electronic power subsystem designers and integrators, as well
    as power element manufacturers and suppliers. It addresses system-level issues
    in element or subsystem integration, adaptation, and accommodation. It also defines
    system-level interface parameters, test methods, and test conditions. It provides
    for a systems engineering approach to acquisition, adaptation, and integration
    of electronic power subsystems, facilitates and promotes a modular approach to
    element or subsystem integration, and enables effective communication between
    the end users of power electronics and their manufacturers or suppliers.
