abstract:
- content: Software verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes, which determine
    whether development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of
    that activity, and whether the software satisfies its intended use and user needs,
    are described. This determination may include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection,
    assessment, and testing of software products and processes. V&amp;V processes
    assess the software in the context of the system, including the operational environment,
    hardware, interfacing software, operators, and users.
