abstract:
- content: This amendment defines modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 medium access
    control layer (MAC) and physical layers (PHY). Compared to IEEE Std 802.11-2020
    it enables absolute and relative position estimation with higher accuracy, and
    reduces wireless medium utilization and power consumption, is scalable to dense
    deployments, and includes security features.
