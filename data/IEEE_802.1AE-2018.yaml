abstract:
- content: How all or part of a network can be secured transparently to peer protocol
    entities that use the MAC Service provided by IEEE 802&#x00AE; LANs to communicate
    is specified in this standard. MAC security (MACsec) provides connectionless user
    data confidentiality, frame data integrity, and data origin authenticity.(The
    PDF of this standard is available at no cost to you compliments of the IEEE GET
    program https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page).
