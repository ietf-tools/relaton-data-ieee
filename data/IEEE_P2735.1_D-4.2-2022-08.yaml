abstract:
- content: This standard designs and standardizes data input interfaces, computing
    service interfaces, interconnection service interfaces, LIMS service interfaces,
    functional design requirements, and constraints for Complex Virtual Instruments(CVI)
    in the field of household appliance testing based on IEEE 2735, which the purpose
    is to process the data or metadata from different types of household appliance
    complex virtual instruments.
