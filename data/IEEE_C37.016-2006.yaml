abstract:
- content: This Standard is applicable to AC circuit switchers designed for outdoor
    installation and for rated power frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz and rated maximum
    voltages of 15.5 kV through 245 kV. It is only applicable to three-pole circuit
    switchers for use in three-phase systems. This Standard is also applicable to
    the operating devices of circuit switchers and to their auxiliary equipment.
