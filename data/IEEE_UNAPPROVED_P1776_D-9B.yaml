abstract:
- content: A test procedure (Combination of IEEE Stds. 275-1992 &#8482; & 429-1994
    &#8482;) for comparing two or more insulation systems in accordance with their
    expected life at rated temperature is outlined. The procedure is limited to insulation
    systems for alternating-current (ac) electrical machines using form-wound pre-insulated
    stator coils rated 15000 V and below.
