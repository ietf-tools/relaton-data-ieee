abstract:
- content: The evolution of the harmonized set of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288-12207 related
    standards and technical reports that are discussed in this International Standardprovides
    detailed requirements and guidance on the application of system life cycle processes.
    This International Standard unifies technical and managementrequirements and guidance
    from several of these sources to specify the requirements for the content of a
    SEMP and to provide a common SEMP format. This International Standard also identifies
    the processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 to perform the necessary project
    planning activities to accomplish the project's technical effort and to develop
    the project's SEMP. Due to close alignment with the content of ISO/IEC 24748,
    ISO/IEC 26702 is now Part 4 of the multi-part International Standard, ISO/IEC
    24748 (Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle management).
