abstract:
- content: 'Electromagnetic performance requirements for replaceable electronic modules
    (REMs) are specified. This standard is suitable for items that have the following
    features: removable/replaceable electronic circuit modules that plug into an equipment
    rack or frame, with electrical interconnections primarily through edge connectors
    that interface directly with a backplane, and electrical power input derived from
    the backplane power sources. This standard is based on MIL-STD-461E system/equipment
    level electromagnetic interference (EMI) controls. The conducted and radiated
    requirements, limits, and test methods were adapted to provide risk reduction
    of REM EMI before integration in a system/equipment.'
