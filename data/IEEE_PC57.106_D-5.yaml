abstract:
- content: 'This guide applies to mineral oil used in transformers, load tap changers,
    voltage regulators, reactors, and circuit breakers. The guide discusses the following:
    a) Analytical tests and their significance for the evaluation of mineral insulating
    oil; b) The evaluation of new, unused mineral insulating oil before and after
    filling into equipment; c) Methods of handling and storage of mineral insulating
    oil; d) The evaluation of service-aged mineral insulating oil; e) Health and environmental
    care procedures for mineral insulating oil. The characteristics of the oils discussed
    in this guide does not include oil that is in factory fill lines, nor does this
    guide cover reclaimed oil installed in new equipment. The characteristics of the
    oils discussed in this guide does not include oil that is in factory fill lines,
    nor does this guide cover reclaimed oil installed in new equipment. The qualities
    of such oil, if used, should be agreed upon by the manufacturer and the user of
    the equipment.'
