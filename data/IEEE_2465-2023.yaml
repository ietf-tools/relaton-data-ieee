abstract:
- content: Pulse-type partial discharge test methods for individual form-wound stator
    coils and bars that are equipped with PD suppression coatings and energized with
    a sinusoidal voltage source are described in this recommended practice. A uniform
    procedure for measurements in terms of apparent charge at frequencies below 1
    MHz and for measurements in millivolts at higher frequencies, up to 300 MHz is
    also provided in this recommended practice. This document does not provide pass/fail
    criteria, but it does describe the measurement circuit, the simulated slot, external
    factors affecting the measurements, the recommended method for calibration or
    normalization, appropriate test voltage levels, the need for and parameters of
    conditioning, and it provides guidelines for interpretation of test results.
