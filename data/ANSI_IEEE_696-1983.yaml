abstract:
- content: 'This standard is intended: (1) To define a rational, general-purpose interface
    system for designers of new computer system components that will ensure their
    compatibility with present and future IEEE Std 696 computer systems.(2) To provide
    the microprocessor computer-system user with compatible device families which
    will communicate in an unambiguous way without modification, from which a modularly
    expandable computer system may be constructed.(3) To enable the interconnection
    of independently manufactured devices into a single system.(4) To specify terminology
    and definitions related to the system.(5) To define a system with the minimum
    number of restrictions on the performance characteristics of devices connected
    to the system.(6) To define a system that, of itself, is of relatively low cost,
    and allows the interconnection of low-cost devices.(7) To define a system that
    is easy to use.'
