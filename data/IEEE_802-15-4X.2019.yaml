abstract:
- content: Enhancements to the IEEE 802.15.4(TM) smart utility network (SUN) orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) physical layers (PHYs) that enable support
    for data rates up to 2.4 Mb/s are defined by this amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.4(TM)-2015.
    This amendment also defines additional channel plans, as needed, to support emerging
    applications. (The PDF of this standard is available at no cost compliments of
    the IEEE GET program at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=68).
