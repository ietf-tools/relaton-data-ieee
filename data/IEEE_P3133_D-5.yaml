abstract:
- content: This guide specifies the DC ice-melting conditions, melting current, melting
    duration and the amplitude of harmonics injected into the power grid to support
    the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of DC ice-melting. This guide also specifies
    the technical parameters, inspection, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of DC
    ice-melting devices. The purpose of this guide is to provide DC ice-melting methods
    which can be used to help prevent collapse of power transmission towers as well
    as disconnection and outage of transmission lines under continuous snow and freezing
    rain.
