abstract:
- content: This standard provides general requirements, directions, and methods for
    qualifying fiber optic cables, connections, and optical fiber splices for use
    in safety systems of nuclear power generating stations, including fuel reprocessing
    stations and other related installations. Cables, optical fibers, and splices
    within or integral to other devices (e.g., sensors, instruments, panels, etc.)
    shall be qualified using the requirements in the applicable device standard or
    IEEE Std 323 -2003, as appropriate. However, the requirements of this standard
    may be applied to the fiber optic cable and interfaces within these devices.
