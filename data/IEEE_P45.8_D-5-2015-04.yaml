abstract:
- content: IEEE-45-8 is a member of the IEEE 45 Series and associated with eight sub-documents
    (IEEE-45.1 through 45.8). Although intended to provide a consensus of recommended
    practices for cable systems on shipboard, this document may also be of benefit
    for information purposes in the proper selection and installation of wire and
    cable in commercial or military coastal vessels, or offshore drilling and production
    platforms. These cables include low voltage cables, medium voltage cables, and
    specialty cables.
