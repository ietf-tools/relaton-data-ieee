abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. Low-votage metal-enclosed switchgear, which can contain
    either stationary or drawout, manually or electrically operated low-voltage ac
    or dc power circuit breakers in individual grounded metal compartments, in three-pole,
    two-pole, or single-pole construction is covered. Rated maximum voltage levels
    can be 254 V, 508 V, or 635 Vac and 300/325 Vm 800V, 1000 V, 1600V, or 3200 Vdc.
    The continuous current ratings of the main bus in ac designs can be 1600 A, 2000
    A, 2500 A, 4000 A, 6000 A, 8000 A, 10 000 A, or 12 000 A. The switchgear can also
    contain associated control, instruments, metering, protective, and regulating
    devices as necessary. The standard deals with service conditions, rating, temperature
    limitations, and classification of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric)
    withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application.
