abstract:
- content: These recommended practices will aid electrical systems designers in achieving
    safety of life and preservation of property through operational considerations
    to reduce electrical failures; to allow maintenance with a minimum need for specialized
    services; to present design considerations that recognize the flexibility of electrical
    systems in terms of layout and placement while fulfilling the requirements for
    proper electrical installation; and to promote coordination of design with professional
    associates.
