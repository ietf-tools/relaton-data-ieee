abstract:
- content: The protocol, data encapsulations, and presentation time procedures used
    to ensure interoperability between audio- and video-based end stations that use
    standard networking services provided by all IEEE 802 networks meeting quality-of-service
    requirements for time sensitive applications by leveraging concepts of IEC 61883
    are specified in this standard.
