abstract:
- content: The IEEE P2840 standard pertains to licenses which, by subscribing to this
    standard, meaningfully engage with the spirit of responsible use of AI systems.
    In this regard, the standard is not intended to define what a license or contract
    is--these are well understood by legal systems across the world. Rather, licenses
    subscribing to the IEEE P2840 standard shall adhere to and specify clauses that
    pertain to dimensions of use (i.e., capabilities, consequences, areas of application)
    of specific technical artifacts.
