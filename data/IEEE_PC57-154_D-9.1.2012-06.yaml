abstract:
- content: This standard applies to all liquid-immersed distribution, power and regulating
    transformers that are designed to operate at temperatures that exceed the normal
    thermal limits of C57.12.00, under continuous load, in the designed average ambient
    and at rated conditions. This standard provides specific requirements and guidance
    in the design, testing and application of the transformers covered within its
    scope. These transformers incorporate high-temperature insulation systems or systems
    that use a combination of high-temperature and conventional insulation.
