abstract:
- content: Over the past several years, outdoor metal-clad switchgear has reached
    a position of widespread application comparable to that of indoor gear. Its satisfactory
    record for many years in cold, temperate, and hot climates has contributed to
    this increased usage. However, there are conditions affecting its application
    which are different from those for indoor gear and warrant special consideration.This
    was realized and a study of the situation was undertaken by the AIEE Switchgear
    Assemblies Subcommittee. It was first determined that temperature data were not
    available on fully loaded units in the field. Outdoor laboratory and field testing
    was then tried, and it became evident, due to uncontrollable conditions, that
    accurate and complete data suitable for establishing the current-carrying capability
    of outdoor metal-clad switchgear could not be obtained. Next, indoor testing simulating
    outdoor conditions was resorted to. Further valuable data were accumulated, but
    there is still no absolute relationship between results obtained indoors and conditions
    existing outdoors. However, based on these investigations, sufficient data are
    now available for the preparation of a Guide for using outdoor metal-clad switchgear
    in various climates.
