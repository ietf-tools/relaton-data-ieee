abstract:
- content: A discussion of the available standard phase shifters, the general principles
    of measurement techniques, and the basic measurement precautions is included in
    this report along with a bibliography of pertinent literature. This is one of
    a series of such reports planned under a program being carried out by the IEEE.
    The data in this report have been assembled by a special subcommittee working
    in the field of microwave phase-shift measurements.
