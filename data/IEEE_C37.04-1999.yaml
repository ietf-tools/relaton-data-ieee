abstract:
- content: This standard covers the rating structure for all high-voltage circuit
    breakers, which include all voltage ratings above 1000 V ac and comprise both
    indoor and outdoor types having the preferred ratings as listed in ANSI C37.06-1997.
    Typical circuit breakers covered by these standards have maximum voltage ratings
    ranging from 4.76 kV through 800 kV, and continuous current ratings of 600 A,1200
    A, 2000 A, and 3000 A associated with the various maximum voltage ratings. The
    rating structure establishes the basis for all assigned ratings, including continuous
    current, dielectric withstand voltages,short-circuit current, transient recovery
    voltage, and capacitor switching, plus associated capabilities such as mechanical
    endurance, load current, and out-of-phase switching. This standard does not cover
    generator circuit breakers, which are covered in IEEE Std C37.013-1997.
