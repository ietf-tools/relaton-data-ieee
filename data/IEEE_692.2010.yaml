abstract:
- content: Criteria are provided for the design of an integrated security system for
    nuclear power generating stations. Requirements are included for the overall system,
    interfaces, subsystems, and individual electrical and electronic equipment. This
    standard addresses equipment for security-related detection, surveillance, access
    control, communication, data acquisition, and threat assessment.

- content: The standard provides criteria for the design, testing, and maintenance
    of security system equipment for nuclear power generating stations. Such equipment
    includes permanently or temporarily installed systems, subsystems, and components
    used by the security force for physical protection of the station against security
    threats. It includes equipment for security-related detection, assessment, surveillance,
    access control, communication, and data acquisition.
