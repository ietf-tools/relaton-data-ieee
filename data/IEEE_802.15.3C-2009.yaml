abstract:
- content: This amendment defines an alternative physical layer (PHY) for IEEE Std
    802.15.3-2003. Three PHY modes have been defined that enable data rates in excess
    of 5 Gb/s using the 60 GHz band. A beamforming protocol has been defined to improve
    the range of communicating devices. Aggregation and block acknowledgment have
    been defined to improve the medium access control (MAC) efficiency at the high
    data rates provided for by the PHY.
