abstract:
- content: 'This document provides a uniform method of VLF testing in order to obtain
    consistent results, accumulate meaningful experience, and lead to establishment
    of standards of test level. The purposes of this recommended practice are: (1)
    to define terms that have a specific meaning in VLF testing; (2) to describe VLF-test
    equipment and wave shape; (3) to provide a uniform procedure for testing the armature
    insulation of large AC machines with VLF voltage; (4) to recommend constants for
    relating VLF tests to power-frequency and direct-voltage tests to obtain equally
    effective test levels. The document applies to large AC rotating machines rated
    at 10000 kVA or greater and rated 6000 V or higher. It covers acceptance testing
    of new equipment in the factory or onsite after erection. This recommended practice
    also covers routine maintenance testing of machines that have been in service.<<ETX>>'
