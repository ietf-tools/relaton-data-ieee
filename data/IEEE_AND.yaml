abstract:
- content: 'Dependence on technology is growing, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Yet, the safe use of technology depends on cybersecurity, which is failing to
    keep up. This failure can derail the global benefits that humanity should achieve
    from cyberspace and its technologies. Some four million professionals work in
    the cybersecurity field. IEEE could play a major role in this global community,
    and in addressing the growing cybersecurity threat, based on four strengths: IEEE’s
    commitment to advancing technology for humanity; its global presence and independence;
    its engagement across the technology “stack”; and its experience in both cyber
    research and industry. This report reviews the IEEE experience and its potential
    role in the global cybersecurity community. Feedback is welcome for future improvements
    and updates to this report.'
