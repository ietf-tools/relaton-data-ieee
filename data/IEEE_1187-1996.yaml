abstract:
- content: This IEEE standard covers recommended design practices and procedures for
    storage, location, mounting, ventilation, instrumentation, preassembly, assembly,
    and charging of valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) storage batteries. Recommended
    safety practices are also included. This recommended practice applies to all VRLA
    battery stationary installations.
