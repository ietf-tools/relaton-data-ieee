abstract:
- content: Characteristics are provided in this standard relating to performance,
    limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and guidance to assist in
    the proper selection of sealed dry type transformers having a high voltage of
    at least 601 Volts. Specific rating combinations are described in the range from
    750 to 5000 kVA inclusive, with high-voltage 2400 to 34500 Volts inclusive and
    low-voltage 208Y/120 to 4160 Volts inclusive. The fill gases used in these sealed
    dry-type power transformers are not explicitly defined. This standard does not
    apply to other types of transformers, such as those transformers described as
    exceptions in IEEE C57.12.01, as well as ventilated dry-type, non-ventilated dry-type,
    and liquid-immersed, and transformers.
