abstract:
- content: A standard for high-speed communication devices via electric power lines,
    so called broadband over power line (BPL) devices, is defined. Transmission frequencies
    below 100 MHz are used. All classes of BPL devices can use this standard, including
    BPL devices used for the first-mile/last-mile connection to broadband services
    as well as BPL devices used in buildings for local area networks (LANs), Smart
    Energy applications, transportation platforms (vehicle) applications, and other
    data distribution. The balanced and efficient use of the power line communications
    channel by all classes of BPL devices is the main focus of this standard, defining
    detailed mechanisms for coexistence and interoperability between different BPL
    devices, and ensuring that desired bandwidth and quality of service may be delivered.
    The necessary security questions are addressed to ensure the privacy of communications
    between users and to allow the use of BPL for security sensitive services.
