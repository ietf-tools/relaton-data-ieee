abstract:
- content: The purpose of this Standard is to formalize existing standards for 5-level
    perforated tape used in communications; to include standards for 6-level, 7-level,
    and 8-level tape which will be compatible with these 5-level standards, in order
    to prevent confusion and minimize possible obsolescence of existing communications
    apparatus; and to serve as a basis for an American Standard covering perforated
    tape for communications use.
