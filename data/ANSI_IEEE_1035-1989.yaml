abstract:
- content: 'The following topics were dealt with: This test procedure is a recommended
    practice for testing utility-interconnected static power converters. The test
    procedure applies to single- and three-phase units rated from 1 kW to 500 kW and
    may also be applied in principle to larger units. The objective of this test procedure
    is the measurement of electrical parameters at the AC terminals of the power converter.
    The test procedure may serve as a basis for factory or acceptance testing. It
    focuses on equipment that lends itself to mass production and is readily interconnected
    to an electric utility, rather than on equipment subject to site-specific design
    and testing. Test results may be used in evaluating or comparing different types
    of static power converters.<<ETX>>'
