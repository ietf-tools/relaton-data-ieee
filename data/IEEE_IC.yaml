abstract:
- content: 'This document focuses on forming a community of interest from industry,
    academia, and government, intending to develop a standards roadmap for Big Data
    Governance and Metadata Management (BDGMM). The approach includes the following:
    *Review BDGMM-related technology trends, use cases, general requirements, and
    reference architecture; * Gain an understanding of what standards are available
    or under development that may apply to BDGMM; * Perform standards, gap analysis,
    and document the findings; and * Document vision and recommendations for future
    BDGMM standards activities that could have a significant industry impact. Within
    the multitude of best practices and standards applicable to BDGMM-related technology,
    this document focuses on approaches that: (1) apply to situations encountered
    in BDGMM; (2) explore best BDGMM architectures that may be nonexistent, and (3)
    facilitate addressing BDGMM industry use cases’ needs.'
