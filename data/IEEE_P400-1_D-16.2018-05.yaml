abstract:
- content: The recommended practices and procedures for direct voltage acceptance
    and maintenance testing of shielded, laminated, dielectric-insulated power cable
    systems rated 5 kV to 500 kV are presented in this guide. It applies to all types
    of laminated power cable systems such as paper insulated, lead covered, pipe-type,
    and pressurized cables that are intended for the transmission or distribution
    of ac electric power. The tabulated test levels assume that the cable systems
    have an effectively grounded neutral system or a grounded metallic shield.
