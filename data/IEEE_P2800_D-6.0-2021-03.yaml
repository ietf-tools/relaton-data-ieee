abstract:
- content: Uniform technical minimum requirements for the interconnection, capability,
    and lifetime performance of inverter-based resources interconnecting with transmission
    and sub transmission systems are established in this standard. Included in this
    standard are performance requirements for reliable integration of inverter-based
    resources into the bulk power system, including, but not limited to, voltage and
    frequency ride-through, active power control, reactive power control, dynamic
    active power support under abnormal frequency conditions, dynamic voltage support
    under abnormal voltage conditions, power quality, negative sequence current injection,
    and system protection. The standard also applies to isolated inverter-based resources
    that are interconnected to an AC transmission system via a dedicated voltage source
    converter high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) transmission facilities; in these
    cases, the standard applies to the combination of the isolated IBR and the VSC-HVDC
    facility and not to the isolated IBR.
