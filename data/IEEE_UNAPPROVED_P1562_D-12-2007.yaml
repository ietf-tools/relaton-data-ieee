abstract:
- content: This guide (in conjunction with IEEE Std. 1013¿) is a recommended method
    for properly sizing the PV array and battery for stand-alone PV systems where
    PV is the only charging source. Special attention needs to be made to load calculations
    and determination of solar radiation in the sizing of the system. Additionally,
    the critical nature of the load needs to be considered in deciding an acceptable
    annual availability.
