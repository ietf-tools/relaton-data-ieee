abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth the minimum acceptable requirements for the performance
    of reliability analyses for safety systems when used to address the reliability
    considerations discussed in industry standards and guidelines. The methods of
    this standard may also be applied to other systems, including the interactions,
    if any, between safety and non-safety systems. The requirements should be applied
    during the phases of design, fabrication, testing, maintenance, and repair of
    systems and components in nuclear power generating stations. The timing of the
    analysis depends upon the purpose for which the analysis is performed. This standard
    applies to the facility owner and other organizations responsible for the activities
    previously stated.
