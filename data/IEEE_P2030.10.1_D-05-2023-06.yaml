abstract:
- content: This standard provides specifications for Direct Current (DC) -based installations
    to address requirements given in Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the Multi-Tier framework.
    The Multi-Tier framework is discussed in detail in the Energy Sector Management
    Assistance Program (ESMAP) report published by the World Bank. This standard provides
    installation rules for basic electricity supply from a renewable source and is
    meant to be used in areas that are not connected to the AC public distribution
    network. The standard advocates use of a safety extra low voltage (SELV) that
    can be safer to operate under normal, dry conditions. Circuit/branch current is
    limited to make it more difficult for an arc to propagate. This approach delivers
    power access possible without needing special parts. The resultant installation
    can use wiring that is similar to that used in an AC system in a cost-effective
    and scalable manner.
