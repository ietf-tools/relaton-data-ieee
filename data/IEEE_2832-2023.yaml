abstract:
- content: This document provides general guidance on the control and protection tests
    of hybrid multi-terminal high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems that consist
    of line-commutated converter (LCC) at the sending end and voltage source converter
    (VSC) at the receiving end. It involves preconditions, composition of the test
    system, test contents and boundaries, test items and design principles, and organization
    and quality control requirements. The tests involved include factory test, acceptance
    test, site commissioning test, and trial operation.
