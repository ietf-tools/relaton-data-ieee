abstract:
- content: This standard is applicable to bushings intended for use in high-voltage
    circuit breakers and gas-insulated switchgear. These bushings are intended for
    indoor and outdoor use, operating on alternating current with a rated voltage
    greater than 1000 V and a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. These bushings are usually
    a part of an apparatus and tested according to the apparatus of which they form
    part.
