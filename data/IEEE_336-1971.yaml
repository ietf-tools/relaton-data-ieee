abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth the requirements for installation, inspection,
    and testing of Class I and Class IE electric power, instrumentation, and control
    equipment and systems during the construction phase of a nuclear power generating
    station. These requirements are intended to assure that only materials and equipment
    of acceptable quality are incorporated into the plant, that quality is maintained
    and quality workmanship prevails throughout the construction process, and that
    completed installations conform to specified requirements, so as to promote public
    safety, prevent accidents and mitigate the consequences of accidents if they occur,
    and provide a high degree of plant reliability.
