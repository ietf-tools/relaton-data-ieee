abstract:
- content: Superseded by 18-2002. Capacitors rated 216 V or higher, 2.5 kvar or more,
    and designed for shunt connection to alternating-current transmission and distribution
    systems operating at a nominal frequency of 50 or 60 Hz are considered. Service
    conditions, ratings, manufacturing, and testing are covered. A guide to application
    and operation of power capacitors is included.
