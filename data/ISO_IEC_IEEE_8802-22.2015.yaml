abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the air interface, including the cognitive medium
    access control layer (MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of point-to-multipoint wireless
    regional area networks comprised of a professional fixed base station with fixed
    and portable user terminals operating in the VHF/UHF TV broadcast bands between
    54 MHz to 862 MHz.
