abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies medium access control (MAC) enhancements and minimal
    WirelessMAN-Advanced physical layer (PHY) modifications in licensed bands to support
    lower power consumption at the device, support by the base station of significantly
    larger numbers of devices, efficient support for small burst transmissions, and
    improved device authentication.
