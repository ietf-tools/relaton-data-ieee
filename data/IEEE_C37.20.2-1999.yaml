abstract:
- content: Metal-enclosed medium voltage switchgear (ME), which can contain either
    drawout electrically operated circuit breakers or stationary electrically operated
    circuit breakers in individual three-pole grounded metal compartments, is covered.
    Further, metal-clad switchgear (MC) is compartmentalized to isolate all components
    such as instrumentation, main bus, and both incoming and outgoing connections
    with grounded metal barriers. Rated maximum voltage levels for metal-clad switchgear
    (MC) range from 5 kV through 38 kV with main bus continuous current ratings of
    1200 A, 2000 A, and 3000 A. Rated maximum voltage levels for station-type cubicle
    switchgear (SC) range from 15.5 kV through 72.5 kV with main bus continuous current
    ratings of 2000 A, 3000 A, 4000 A, and 5000 A. ME switchgear also contains associated
    control, instruments, metering, relaying, protective, and regulating devices as
    necessary. Service conditions, ratings, temperature limitations, and classification
    of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements,
    test procedures, and application are discussed.
