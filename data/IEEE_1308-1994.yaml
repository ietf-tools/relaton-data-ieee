abstract:
- content: Specifications that should be provided to characterize instrumentation
    used to measure the steady state RMS value of magnetic and electric fields with
    sinusoidal frequency content in the range 10 Hz to 3 kHz in residential and occupational
    settings as well as in transportation systems are identified. The instrumentation,
    recommended calibration methods, and sources of measurement uncertainty are also
    described.
