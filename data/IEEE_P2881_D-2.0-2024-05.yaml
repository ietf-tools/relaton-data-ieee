abstract:
- content: This Standard is a combination of new and existing metadata terms that
    were contextualized around learning and bundled with the purpose of addressing
    many of the common use cases of metadata. This Standard describes a series of
    classes and properties, that intentionally align to a Resource Description Framework
    (RDF) type of model which can be represented in many formats, including graphs.
    It centers around different types of Learning Resources and Learning Events, distinguishing
    between the two as both were often previously categorized as “Learning Objects”.
    It describes an extensible data model that focuses on the principles of sharing
    learning resources in a learning environment and describing learning events, sometimes
    “instances” of learning resources that learners may attend (virtually or in-person).
