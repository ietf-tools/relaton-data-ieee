abstract:
- content: Guidelines for evaluating electrical insulation materials that are subjected
    to more than one significant aging stress are provided. The focus is on materials
    or equipment intended for use in nuclear facilities, such as power stations, where
    thermal, moisture, and radiation stresses frequently are of importance. Factors
    to consider in accelerated aging programs are identified. Only the design of tests
    is addressed. Specific procedures are not prescribed.
