abstract:
- content: The purpose of this Standard is to make possible the comparison of the
    relative merits of magnetostrictive, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostrictive
    transducers on a simple and straightforward basis. The nomenclature used has evolved
    from a proposed set of definitions for the parameters used in evaluating magnetostrictive
    materials. In the literature, the symbol ' lambda ' has been widely used for the
    magnetostriction constant, the saturation magnetostrictive strain, or occasionally,
    the slope of some other curve associated with magnetostrictive measurement. No
    quantity is represented by ' lambda ' in this standard.<<ETX>>
