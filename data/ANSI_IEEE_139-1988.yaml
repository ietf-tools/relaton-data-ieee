abstract:
- content: This document describes equipment inspection and radio frequency (rf) electromagnetic
    field measurement procedures for evaluation of rf industrial, scientific, and
    medical (ISM) equipment installed in the user's facility. The term, ISM equipment,
    as used here, includes equipment that generates rf energy for purposes other than
    radio communications, to cause physical, chemical, or biological changes; for
    example, industrial heaters (dielectric and induction), medical diathermy, ultrasonic
    equipment, rf plasma devices, and rf stabilized welders. These procedures are
    designed to help ensure that the equipment does not interfere with radio communications,
    navigation, and other essential radio services. The engineer responsible for the
    measurements should take all reasonable precautions to ensure that the maximum
    emission from the ISM equipment under test (EUT) has been measured. Radio frequency
    field-strength measurements of installed ISM equipment may be required if any
    of the following conditions exist:1) The emission from the EUT was not measured
    by the manufacturer. 2) Because of its size or special operating conditions, the
    EUT could not be tested before installation. 3) Installed ISM equipment is suspected
    of causing interference. 4) ISM equipment has been modified in a way that could
    affect its rf emissions. 5) As the equipment ages, there is a question about its
    continued compliance. Etc.
