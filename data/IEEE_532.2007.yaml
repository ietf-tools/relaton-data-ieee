abstract:
- content: This guide covers properties of commonly used jackets as well as selection
    and testing of jackets. It is written for those responsible for optimizing cable
    designs. The purpose is to present a reasonably complete picture of the role of
    jackets so that the subject can be approached in an orderly and organized manner.
    An effort has been made to avoid the highly technical language and theory commonly
    used by electrical engineers and chemists to discuss the more detailed application
    of jackets.
