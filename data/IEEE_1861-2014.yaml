abstract:
- content: On-site acceptance tests of ultra-high-voltage power equipment are subject
    to thisguide. Criteria and requirements for test items, conditions, methods, and
    results are established.The stated specifications and requirements, both technical
    and for testing, are universally neededfor acceptance tests on-site and commissioning
    of ultra-high-voltage power equipment, includingpower transformers, reactors,
    capacitive voltage transformers, bushing-type current transformers,gas-insulated
    switchgear, air insulated grounding switches, air insulated disconnecting switches,bushings,
    metal-oxide surge arresters, suspension insulators, post insulators, and insulating
    oil,etc. It will be sufficient for most installations.
