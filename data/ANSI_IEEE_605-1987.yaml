abstract:
- content: Substation rigid-bus structures reduce substation heights, have greater
    ampacity and lower corona than single conductor strain bus structures. The guide
    presents an integrated design approach for calculating the forces to which rigid
    bus structures are subjected. Design criteria for conductor and insulator strength
    calculations are also included.<<ETX>>
