abstract:
- content: 50 Hz or 60 Hz synchronous generators driven by diesel engines, steam turbines,
    combustion gas turbines, and hydro-turbines are covered in this guide. The drive
    may be direct or through a gear box or other device that permits different speeds
    for the prime mover and the generator. The guide generally applies to the stator
    and rotor of generators with rated outputs of 1 MVA and above. The guide does
    not address machine auxiliaries or the excitation system. This guide will provide
    the generator Owner with insight into the considerations that are necessary when
    rewinding or refurbishing a generator. Particular emphasis is placed on the complete
    rewind of the stator and rotor.
