abstract:
- content: 'Revision of IEEE Std 522-1992 Suggestions are made for testing the dielectric
    strength of the insulation separating the various turns from each other within
    multiturn form-wound coils to determine their acceptability. Typical ratings of
    machines employing such coils normally lie within the range of 200 kW to 100 MW
    (270 hp to 135 000 hp). The test levels described do not evaluate the ability
    of the turn insulation to withstand abnormal voltage surges, only surges associated
    with normal operation. The suggestions apply to: (1) individual stator coils after
    manufacture; (2) coils in completely wound stators; (3) coils and windings for
    rewinds of used machinery; and (4) windings of machines in service to determine
    their suitability for further service (preventive-maintenance testing). Coil service
    conditions, test devices, and test sequence are discussed.'
