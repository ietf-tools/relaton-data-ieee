abstract:
- content: 'This guide describes several methods of measurement for the small signal
    characterization of varactors. For the purpose of this guide, a varactor is defined
    as a twoterminal device used as a voltage-dependent capacitance. Such devices
    can be used from dc to microwave frequencies. Examples include low noise parametric
    amplifiers from audio to microwave frequencies, tuning elements, choppers, and
    phase shifters. A small-signal equivalent circuit is presented and its validity
    discussed. Methods for determining the elements of this circuit by means of ac
    measurements are described in general terms, and restrictions are discussed. The
    use of dc measurement techniques is discussed in Test Procedure for Semiconductor
    Diodes IEEE 256. For a consideration of noise measurements, see Part 9: Noise
    in Linear Twoports, Methods of Testing Electron Tubes - IEEE 158.'
