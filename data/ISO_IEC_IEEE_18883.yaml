abstract:
- content: The enhanced security management function for the protocol defined in IEEE
    1888(TM), Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network Protocol, is described in
    this standard. Security requirements, system security architecture definitions,
    and a standardized description of authentication and authorization, along with
    security procedures and protocols, are specified. This standard can help avoid
    unintended data disclosure to the public and unauthorized access to resources,
    while providing enhanced integrity and confidentiality of transmitted data in
    the ubiquitous green community control network.
