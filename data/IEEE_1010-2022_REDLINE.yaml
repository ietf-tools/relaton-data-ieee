abstract:
- content: Practicing engineers in the hydroelectric industry can use this guide as
    a reference document. Prevailing industry practices in hydroelectric power plant
    control system logic, control system configurations, and control modes are documented.
    The control and monitoring requirements for equipment and systems associated with
    conventional and pumped-storage hydroelectric power plants are described. Typical
    methods of local and remote control, details of the control interfaces for plant
    equipment, and requirements for centralized and off-site control are also included.
