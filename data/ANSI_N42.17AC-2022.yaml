abstract:
- content: The minimum performance criteria for portable radiation protection instrumentation
    are established in this standard for use in ionizing radiation fields under both
    normal and extreme environmental conditions, i.e., all environmental conditions.
    The testing methods verify that the performance criteria are met over the range
    of operating conditions for each type of instrumentation. This standard does not
    specify which instruments or systems are required, nor does it consider the number
    of specific applications of such instruments.
