abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q,1998 Edition describes enhancements to
    allow for classification of incoming packets by methods other than source port.Specifically,
    it defines rules for classification based on data-link layer protocol identification.
    The document identifies proposed changes to the text of IEEE Std 802.1Q,1998 Edition
    that have arisen as a consequence of this activity.These are documented in the
    usual form for amendments to IEEE 802 standards; i.e., as an explicit set of editing
    instructions that,if correctly applied to the text of IEEE Std 802.1Q,1998 Edition,will
    create a corrected document.
