abstract:
- content: This standard is one in a family of Futurebus+TM standards. The Futurebus+
    standards provide a set of tools with which to implement a bus architecture with
    performance and cost scalability over time for multiple generations of single-
    and multiple-bus multiprocessor systems. This standard provides fault tolerant
    extensions to Futurebus+ standards. As such, this standard provides the logical
    layer requirements for the transmission of data in a fault tolerant environment.
    When used in conjunction with other IEEE standards, the details to develop modular,
    open-architecture-based systems fulfilling user needs across a wide computing
    spectrum are available.
