abstract:
- content: In this standard, a parameterized and abstracted power model enabling system,
    software, and hardware intellectual property (IP)&#8211;centric power analysis
    and optimization are described. Concepts and constructs are defined for the development
    of parameterized, accurate, efficient, and complete power models for systems and
    hardware IP blocks usable for system power analysis and optimization. Process,
    voltage, and temperature (PVT) independence; power and thermal management interface;
    and workload and architecture parameterization are some of the concepts included.
