abstract:
  content: This standard applies to all AC high-voltage generator circuit breakers
    rated on a symmetrical current basis, with rated maximum voltage 15.8 kV and above
    with a continuous current rating of 6.3 kA and above that are applied to generator
    terminals. Pumped storage installations are considered a special application,
    and their requirements are not completely covered by this standard
