abstract:
- content: Supersedes C57.12.70-1978 (R1992). Standard terminal markings and connections
    are described for single-phase and three-phase distribution,power,and regulating
    transformers.For terminal markings,it covers sequence designation, external terminal
    designation, neutral terminal designation, grounded terminal designation, and
    marking of full and tap winding terminals. Additive and subtractive polarity and
    parallel transformer operation are described.Connections of single-phase transformers
    in various configurations and angular displacement of three-phase transformers
    to connect to various system phase displacements are covered.
