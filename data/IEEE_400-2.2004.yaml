abstract:
  content: This guide describes very low frequency (VLF) withstand and diagnostic
    tests and the measurements that are performed in the field on shielded power cable
    systems. Whenever possible, cable systems are treated in a similar manner to individual
    cables. Tables are included as an aid to identifying the effectiveness of the
    VLF test for various cable system insulation problems.
