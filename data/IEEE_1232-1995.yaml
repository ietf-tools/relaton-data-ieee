abstract:
- content: SUPERSEDED BY IEEE STD 1232-2002 This document is the base standard for
    the AI-ESTATE set of standards. The overall concept of AIESTATE, which is a set
    of specifications for data interchange and for standard services for the test
    and diagnostic environment, is defined; mandatory requirements for implementing
    AI-ESTATE are specified; the elements of AI-ESTATE and their interrelationships
    are described; guidelines and requirements to govern the documents in the AI-ESTATE
    set of standards are established; and the terminology used throughout the set
    is defined. The purpose of the AI-ESTATE set of standards is to standardize interfaces
    between functional elements of an intelligent test environment and representations
    of knowledge and data for the functional elements of the intelligent test environment.
