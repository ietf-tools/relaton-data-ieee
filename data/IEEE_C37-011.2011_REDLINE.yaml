abstract:
- content: Procedures and calculations necessary to apply the standard transient recovery
    voltage (TRV) ratings for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V
    are covered in this application guide. The breaking capability limits of these
    circuit breakers are determined to a great degree by the TRV. The TRV ratings
    are compared with typical system TRV duties. Examples of TRV calculation are given
    with suggested options if the TRV duty exceeds the TRV ratings of the circuit
    breaker.
