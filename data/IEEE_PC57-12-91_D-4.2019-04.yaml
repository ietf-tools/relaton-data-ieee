abstract:
- content: To reflect current practice in the testing procedures of dry-type transformers,
    substantive changes to Clause 5, Clause 7, Clause 10, Clause 11, and Clause 13
    of IEEE Std C57.12.91-2011 have been made in this revision. Also Annex B has been
    added to provide guidelines for converting test results measured at 60 Hz to the
    equivalent values at 50 Hz and vice versa. This revision does not address transformer
    requirements and specific test criteria; rather they are contained in appropriate
    standards such as IEEE Std C57.12.01 or in user specifications.
