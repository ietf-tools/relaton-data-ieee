abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Std 1528-2003 specifies protocols and test procedures for the measurement
    of the peak spatial-average SAR induced inside a simplified model of the head
    of users of certain handheld radio transceivers. These transceivers are intended
    to be used for personal wireless communications services, operate in the 300 MHz&#8211;3
    GHz frequency range, and are intended to be operated while held against the ear.
    The results obtained by following the protocols specified in this recommended
    practice represent a conservative estimate of the peak spatial-average SAR induced
    in the head of a significant majority of persons, subject to measurement and other
    uncertainties that are defined in this standard. The results are representative
    of those expected during conditions of normal use of a handheld wireless device.
    It is not the intent of this recommended practice to provide a result representative
    of the absolute maximum SAR value possible under every conceivable combination
    of head size, head shape, handset orientation, and spacing relative to the head.
    The measurement of SAR induced in the external tissues of the head, e.g., the
    external ear (pinna), is not addressed in this standard. The following items are
    described in detail: measurement concepts, measurement techniques, instruments,
    calibration techniques, simulated-tissue (phantom) models, including homogeneous
    anatomical models of the human head and simple phantoms for validation of the
    SAR measurement system, and the limitations of these systems when used for measuring
    the spatial-peak mass-averaged SAR. Procedures for calibrating electric field
    (E-field) probes used for SAR measurements and assessing the SAR measurement and
    system uncertainties are provided in the annexes. This recommended practice is
    intended primarily for use by engineers and other specialists who are familiar
    with electromagnetic (EM) theory and measurement techniques.'
