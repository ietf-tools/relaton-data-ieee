abstract:
- content: Information of special relevance to planning, design, testing, installation,
    operation and maintenance of gas-insulated substations (GIS) and equipment is
    provided in this guide, which is intended to supplement IEEE Std C37.122(TM).
    This guide is applicable to all gas-insulated substations (GIS) above 52 kV. However,
    the importance of topics covered varies with application category. For example,
    the issues related to advanced field test techniques and very fast transients
    (VFT) are of particular interest for extra-high voltage (EHV) gas-insulated substations
    (GIS).
