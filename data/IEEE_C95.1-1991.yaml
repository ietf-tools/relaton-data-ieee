abstract:
- content: Recommendations are made to prevent harmful effects in human beings exposed
    to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. The recommendations
    are intended to apply to exposures in controlled, as well as uncontrolled, environments.
    They are not intended to apply to the purposeful exposure of patients by or under
    the direction of practitioners of the healing arts. The recommendations at 300
    GHz are compatible with existing recommendations on safe exposure in the infrared
    frequency range (starting at 300 GHz). A rationale that describes how the recommendations
    were arrived at, and the factors taken into account in formulating them, is included.
