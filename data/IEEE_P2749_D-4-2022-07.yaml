abstract:
- content: This recommended practice presents the risk factors that should be considered
    for the planning, operation, and maintenance of the distribution network. It also
    provides the approaches and practices for risk identification and evaluation,
    including the identification of risk factors and events, classification of risk
    types, evaluation of equipment and network risks, as well as the grading, warning,
    prevention measures, dynamic tracking, and simulation of risks. This recommended
    practice can be applied to the operation risk evaluation and guides the planning,
    construction, and maintenance of conventional power systems, microgrids, and smart
    distribution networks with high penetration of distributed energy resources (DER),
    and flexible loads.
