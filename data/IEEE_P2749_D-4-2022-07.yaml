abstract:
- content: The risk factors that should be considered for the planning, operation,
    and maintenance of the distribution network are presented in this recommended
    practice. The approaches and practices for risk identification and evaluation,
    including the identification of risk factors and events, classification of risk
    types, evaluation of equipment and network risks, as well as the grading, warning,
    prevention measures, dynamic tracking, and simulation of risks are also provided.
    This recommended practice can be applied to the operation risk evaluation and
    guides the planning, construction, and maintenance of conventional power systems,
    microgrids, and smart distribution networks with high penetration of distributed
    energy resources (DER), and flexible loads.
