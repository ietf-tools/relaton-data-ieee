abstract:
- content: A comprehensive guide to practical line current differential schemes using
    digital communications. Operating principles, synchronization methods, channel
    requirements, current transformer requirements, external time reference requirements,
    backup considerations, testing considerations, and troubleshooting are included.
    This guide also provides specific guidelines for various application aspects including
    multi-terminal lines, series compensated lines, mutually coupled lines, line charging
    current, in-zone transformers and reactors, single-phase tripping and reclosing,
    as well as communications channel requirements.
