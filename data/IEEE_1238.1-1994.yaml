abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Mar 06, 2000. A C language Application
    Program Interface (API) to the OSI File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM)
    protocol is defined. The functions of the API implement high-level file transfer
    and file management operations using the service of an FTAM initiator and service
    provider that underlie the API. The API uses the services of the OSI Abstract
    Data Manipulation API (IEEE Std 122-1993) to facilitate passing of data between
    the API and the user.'
