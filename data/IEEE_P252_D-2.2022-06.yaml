abstract:
- content: Instructions for conducting and reporting the generally applicable and
    acceptable tests to determine the performance characteristics of polyphase induction
    motors having liquid in the magnetic gap are given. Constants in several equations
    and forms apply to three-phase motors only and require modifications for applications
    to motors having another number of phases. It is not intended that the procedures
    cover all possible tests or tests of a research nature. The procedures shall not
    be interpreted as requiring the making of any or all of the tests described herein
    in any given transaction.
