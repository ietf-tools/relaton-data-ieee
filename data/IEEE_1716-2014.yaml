abstract:
- content: Recommendations and guidelines for managing natural disaster impact on
    key electrical facilities and systems in petroleum and chemical facilities are
    provided in order to minimize economic damage by pre-assessment risk evaluation
    of electrical facilities, by identification of mitigation techniques and system
    designs to minimize impact, and by outlining procedures for faster recovery of
    electrical systems after a natural disaster.
