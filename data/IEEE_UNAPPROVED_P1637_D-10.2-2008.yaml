abstract:
- content: The guide has been developed to provide a step-by-step process for selecting
    an appropriate termination that is commensurate with a particular underground
    cable design. Over the years, underground cables have been developed that employ
    many different insulating materials and many different shielding systems, such
    that, there are numerous issues to consider when selecting a termination for a
    particular cable design. Over the same period of time, many different termination
    methods and designs have been developed that serve the same purpose, but employ
    different application methodologies. The guide does not attempt to cover every
    cable and termination design, and is generally restricted to single conductor
    Underground Residential Distribution (URD) and power cable that have a voltage
    rating from 5 to 46 kV. By nature, the terminations referred to in this guide
    are considered to be &ldquo;live front&rdquo;, in that the terminations comprise
    a transition from an underground cable to an energized component or bus that is
    either bare or simply covered.
