abstract:
- content: This standard applies to all types of electrically controlled indoor and
    outdoor power circuit breakers, including circuit breakers in switchgear cubicles
    and in metal-clad switchgear, having an interrupting rating of 50 megavolt-amperes
    (mva) or higher and a voltage rating above 1500 volts. This standard applies for
    any source of circuit breaker operating energy, such as solenoid, motor, spring,
    compressed gas, etc, for any type of operating mechanism and for both a-c and
    d-c control power.
