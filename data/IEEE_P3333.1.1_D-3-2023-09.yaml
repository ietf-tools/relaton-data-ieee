abstract:
- content: As the supply and demand for 3D technologies grows, the development of
    accurate quality assessment techniques is necessary to develop the industries
    of the 3D display devices and signal processing engines. Underlying principles
    and statistical characteristics of 3D contents based on human visual system (HVS)
    are described in this standard. In addition, the reliable 3D subjective assessment
    methodology that covers the characteristics of human perception, display mechanism,
    and viewing environment is introduced in this document.
