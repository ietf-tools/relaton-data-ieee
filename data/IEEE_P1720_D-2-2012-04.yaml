abstract:
- content: 'This document 1 describes near-field test practices for the measurement
    of antenna properties and recommends near-field measurement practices for the
    three principal geometries: cylindrical, planar, and spherical. It also recommends
    measurement practices for the calibration of probes used as reference antennas
    in near-field measurements.'
