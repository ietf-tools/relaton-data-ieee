abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 686-1997. This standard is devoted to providing radar
    definitions. The standard includes terms formerly found in IEEE std 172-1971,
    IEEE Standard Definitions of Navigation Aid Terms, with the exception of a few
    terms that are common in both fields, and new and updated terms. IEEE std 172-1983
    was withdrawn in 1983. As radar technology and literature evolve, new terms will
    be added and obsolete terms deleted.
