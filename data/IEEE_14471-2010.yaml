abstract:
- content: This guide adopts ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007. Since computer-aided software
    engineering (CASE) adoption is a subject of the broader technology transition
    problem, this guide addresses the adoption practices appropriate for a wide range
    of computing organizations. ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 neither dictates nor advocates
    particular development standards, software processes, design methods, methodologies,
    techniques, programming languages, or life-cycle paradigms.
