abstract:
- content: The selection and application of power distribution apparatus used in industrial
    and commercial power systems are covered in this recommended practice. It is likely
    to be of greatest value to the power-oriented engineer with limited experience
    with this equipment. It can also bean aid to all engineers responsible for the
    electrical design of industrial and commercial power systems.
