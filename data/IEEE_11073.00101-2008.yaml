abstract:
- content: '"The following Guidance document addresses the use of radio frequency
    1 (RF) wireless technology for the transport of medical data both to and from
    point-of-care (PoC) medical devices. The context of such wireless medical data
    transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory
    and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global
    with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation
    and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this
    Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range
    of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization,
    and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly
    evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after
    the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid
    being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers,
    wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and
    any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance
    and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines
    specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies
    operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless
    metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations
    are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority,
    bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance
    (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless
    technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues
    include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security,
    cost, power consumption, and technology configurability. Performance summaries
    for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended
    as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes,
    and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is
    meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x
    standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies
    for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned
    to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for
    the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates
    will be performed on the IEEE 11073- 0305.x standards only."'
