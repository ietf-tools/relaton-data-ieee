abstract:
- content: The production process of sensitive users is easy to interrupt due to voltage
    sag, resulting in a lot of economic losses. A method to evaluate the economic
    losses of sensitive industrial users due to voltage sag is provided in this guide.
    This document specifies the costs of power quality monitoring and voltage sag
    mitigation projects for power users, proposes the economic loss indexes due to
    voltage sag, and introduces the technical and economic evaluation method of voltage
    sag mitigation projects. This document gives the process of evaluating the economic
    loss due to voltage sag and the decision-making of mitigation scheme, and recommends
    the experimental method of testing user equipment and production line.
