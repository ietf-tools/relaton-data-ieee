abstract:
- content: Recommended methods and standardized reporting practices for electricalcharacterization
    of printed and organic ring oscillators are covered. Due to the nature of printedand
    organic circuits, significant measurement errors can be introduced if the electricalcharacterization
    design-of-experiment is not properly addressed. This standard describes themost
    common sources of measurement error, particularly for high-impedance electricalmeasurements
    commonly required for printed and organic ring oscillators. This standard alsogives
    recommended practices in order to minimize and/or characterize the effect of measurementartifacts
    and other sources of error encountered while measuring printed and organic ringoscillators.
