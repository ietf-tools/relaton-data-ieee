abstract:
- content: This amendment defines changes to the IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015 SUN PHYs enabling
    the use of the 870-876 MHz &amp; 915-921 MHz bands in Europe, the 902-928 MHz
    band in Mexico, the 902-907.5 MHz &amp; 915-928 MHz bands in Brazil, the 915-928
    MHz band in Australia/New Zealand and Asian regional frequency bands that are
    not in IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015. This amendment also changes the channel parameters
    listed in the SUN PHYs, Low Energy Critical Infrastructure Monitoring (LECIM)
    PHY and the TV White Space (TVWS) PHY for the 470-510 MHz band in China and the
    863-870 MHz band in Europe, and aligns these channel parameters with regional
    requirements. The amendment includes channel access and/or timing changes to the
    MAC necessary for conformance to regional requirements for these bands.
