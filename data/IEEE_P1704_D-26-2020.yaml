abstract:
- content: Extension to IEEE Std 1703(TM), “IEEE Standard for Local Area Network/Wide
    Area Network (LAN/WAN) Node Communication Protocol to Complement the Utility Industry
    End Device Data Tables”. This extension specifies the physical hardware interfaces
    and signals, such as logical interface and power (digital and mains), that link
    metrology devices to communications modules via the USB physical layer. The communication
    module described in this Standard is not integral (not on the same circuit board)
    with the metrology registers (circuit board) of the assembly. However the module
    is envisioned to partner with a device implementing measurement registers (energy,
    demand load, power quality and related quantities) that are semantically modeled
    using IEEE Std 1377(TM), “IEEE Standard for Utility Industry Metering Communication
    Protocol Application Layer (End Device Data Tables)” and encapsulated for communication
    using IEEE Std 1703(TM) application layer messages.
