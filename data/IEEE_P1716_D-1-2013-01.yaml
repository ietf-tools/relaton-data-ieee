abstract:
- content: This document provides recommendations and guidelines for managing natural
    disaster impact on key electrical facilities and systems in petroleum and chemical
    facilities in order to minimize economic damage by pre-assessment risk evaluation
    of electrical facilities, by identification of mitigation techniques and systems
    designs to minimize impact, and by outlining procedures for faster recovery of
    electrical systems after a natural disaster.
