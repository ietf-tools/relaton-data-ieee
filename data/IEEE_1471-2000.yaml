abstract:
- content: '" This recommended practice addresses the activities of the creation,
    analysis, and sus-tainment of architectures of software-intensive systems, and
    the recording of such architectures interms of architectural descriptions . A
    conceptual framework for architectural description is estab-lished. The content
    of an architectural description is defined. Annexes provide the rationale for
    keyconcepts and terminology, the relationships to other standards, and examples
    of usage. "'
