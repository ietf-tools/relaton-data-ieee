abstract:
- content: Assisting users in specifying the functional requirements for transmission
    static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) systems using forced commutated technology
    based on voltage sourced converter topologies is the purpose of this guide. These
    systems may be hybrid,and also incorporate thyristor and mechanically switched
    inductors and capacitors. Reactive power compensation, voltage regulation and
    control, transient and dynamic stability, and control and protection are the functions
    included. Accepted engineering practices for the application of STATCOM systems
    are presented. Specifications, typical application requirements, engineering studies,
    main component characteristics, system functions and features, factory testing,
    commissioning, and operations are covered. Informative annexes that allow users
    to develop or modify specific clauses to meet the requirements of a particular
    transmission system application are included.
