abstract:
- content: This standard covers definite purpose switching devices for use in metal-enclosed
    low-voltage power circuit breaker switchgear. The switching devices shall be fused,
    drawout type, three-pole construction, with one or more rated maximum ac voltages
    of 600 V, 508 V, and 254 V for application on systems having nominal ac voltages
    of 600 V, 480 V, and 240 V. The switching devices are power operated with integral
    or separately mounted overcurrent protective devices. This standard addresses
    service conditions, ratings, functional components, temperature limitations and
    classifications of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage
    requirements, test procedures, and application. The switching devices are normally
    used in applications that require frequency of operation greater than normal operations
    expected of low-voltage power circuit breakers.
