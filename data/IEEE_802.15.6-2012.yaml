abstract:
- content: Short-range, wireless communications in the vicinity of, or inside, a human
    body (but not limited to humans) are specified in this standard. It uses existing
    industrial scientific medical (ISM) bands as well as frequency bands approved
    by national medical and/or regulatory authorities. Support for quality of service
    (QoS), extremely low power, and data rates up to 10 Mbps is required while simultaneously
    complying with strict non-interference guidelines where needed. This standard
    considers effects on portable antennas due to the presence of a person (varying
    with male, female, skinny, heavy, etc.), radiation pattern shaping to minimize
    the specific absorption rate (SAR) into the body, and changes in characteristics
    as a result of the user motions.
