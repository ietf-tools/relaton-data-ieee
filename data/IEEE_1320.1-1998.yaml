abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2004. IDEF0 function modeling is designed to represent the decisions,
    actions, and activities of an existing or prospective organization or system.
    IDEF0 graphics and accompanying texts are presented in an organized and systematic
    way to gain understanding, support analysis, provide logic for potential changes,
    specify requirements, and support system-level design and integration activities.
    IDEF0 may be used to model a wide variety of systems, composed of people, machines,
    materials, computers, and information of all varieties and structured by the relationships
    among them, both automated and non-automated. For new systems, IDEF0 may be used
    first to define requirements and to specify functions to be carried out by the
    future system. As the basis of this architecture, IDEF0 may then be used to design
    an implementation that meets these requirements and performs these functions.
    For existing systems, IDEF0 can be used to analyze the functions that the system
    performs and to record the means by which these are done.
