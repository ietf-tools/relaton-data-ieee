abstract:
- content: oManual is a standard for storing and transmitting procedural manuals.
    oManuals common data format can be used as an offline file package or via online
    RESTful API endpoints, using XML or JSON. This format is useful for documenting
    and describing repairs, how-to, workinstructions, or any other step-by-step guides.
    oManual makes it easy to exchange procedural information between services while
    maintaining usability on mobile devices.This specification describes the oManual
    data model, web services API, and bundle file format (a collection of structured
    files containing a category XML format, a guide XML format and related multimedia).
    The specification may be expanded in the future to enable additional types of
    documents.
