abstract:
- content: A Secure Device Identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device
    and supports authentication of the device s identity. Locally significant identities
    can be securely associated with an initial manufacturer-provisioned DevID and
    used in provisioning and authentication protocols to allow a network administrator
    to establish the trustworthiness of a device and select appropriatepolicies for
    transmission and reception of data and control protocols to and from the device.
