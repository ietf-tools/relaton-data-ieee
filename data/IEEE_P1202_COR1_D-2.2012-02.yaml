abstract:
  content: Standardization of cable flame propagation testing is beneficial to cable
    manufacturers, distributors, and users. Uniform procedures; consistent, repeatable
    results; and measurable test acceptance criteria are required to allow comparisons
    among competing products and to allow selection of the correct product for the
    application.
