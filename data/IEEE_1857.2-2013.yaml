abstract:
- content: This standard defines a set of tools to support specific audio coding functions
    including general audio coding and lossless audio coding. The tool set defined
    in this standard, in combination provides regular high quality and efficient coding
    tool sets for compression, decompression, processing, and representing of audio
    data to save bandwidth for transmission, to save space for storage, to speed up
    indexing and multimedia search, and to enhance performance when using mixed media
    for virtual reality and other applications that demand high bandwidth. The target
    applications and services include but not limited audio transmission, audio recording,
    internet streaming, and other video/audio enabled services and applications.
