abstract:
  content: This amendment defines modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 physical layer
    (PHY) and the medium access control (MAC) sublayer to enable operation of license-exempt
    802.11 wireless networks in frequency bands below 1 GHz excluding the TV White
    Space bands, with a transmission range up to 1 km and a minimum data rate of at
    least 100 Kb/s.
