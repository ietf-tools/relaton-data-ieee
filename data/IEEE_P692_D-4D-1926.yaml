abstract:
- content: Criteria are provided for the design of an integrated security system for
    nuclear powergenerating stations. Requirements are included for the overall system,
    interfaces, subsystems, andindividual electrical and electronic equipment. This
    standard addresses equipment for security-relateddetection, surveillance, access
    control, communication, data acquisition, and threat assessment.
