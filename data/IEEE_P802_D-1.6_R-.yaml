abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Std 802-2001, IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks:
    Overviewand Architecture, provides an overview to the family of IEEE 802 standards.
    It describes therelationship of IEEE 802 standards to the Open Systems Interconnection
    Basic Reference Model(ISO/IEC 7498-1:1994) and explains the relationship of these
    standards to the higher layerprotocols; it provides a standard for the structure
    of LAN MAC addresses; it provides a standard foridentification of public, private,
    prototype, and standard protocols; and it defines an object identifier hierarchy
    used within IEEE 802 for uniform allocation of object identifiers used in IEEE
    802 standards.'
