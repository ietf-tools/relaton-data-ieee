abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the Color Books family. System protection
    and coordination serve to minimize damage to a system and its components, thereby
    limiting the extent and duration of any service interruption occurring on any
    portion of the system. The IEEE Buff Book deals with the proper selection, application,
    and coordination of the components that constitute system protection for industrial
    plants and commercial buildings. The IEEE Buff Book presents complete information
    on protection and coordination principles designed to protect industrial and commercial
    power systems against any abnormalities that could reasonably be expected to occur
    during the course of system operation. The information is arranged in a convenient
    step-by-step format for easy comprehension. It is a valuable sourcebook for use
    at the system design stage, as well as in the modification of existing operations
    for better system protection. The IEEE Buff Book supports the goal of system protection
    by efficiently isolating and removing problems. In achieving this goal, certain
    design features must be utilized. One of the main design features involves the
    rapid isolation of the affected portion of the system, while maintaining normal
    operation elsewhere. Another design feature reduces the short-circuit current
    to minimize damage to the system, its components, and the utilization equipment
    it supplies. Yet another design feature provides alternate circuits, automatic
    throw overs, and automatic reclosing devices. These design features for system
    protection are the focus of the IEEE Buff Book. An errata is available at https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/erratas/242-2001_errata.pdf
