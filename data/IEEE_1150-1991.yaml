abstract:
- content: A data model, called the plant information network, that standardizes categories
    of generating plant data and data relationships, is presented. Guidelines are
    provided for using the model to integrate computer-aided engineering (CAE) applications
    across the spectrum of plant-work activities during the complete cycle of the
    plant from site selection through decommissioning. Instructions are given to aid
    the engineering, construction, and operating groups of the utility in specifying
    integrated CAE applications. The information engineering concepts that are the
    basis for integrated CAE development are covered.<<ETX>>
