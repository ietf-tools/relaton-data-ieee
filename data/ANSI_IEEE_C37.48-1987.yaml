abstract:
- content: Superseded. Information on the application, operation, and maintenance
    of high-voltage fuses (above 1000 V), distribution enclosed single-pole air switches,
    fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories for use on AC distribution systems
    is provided. This guide is one of a series of complementary standards covering
    various types of high-voltage fuses and switches, so arranged that two of the
    standards apply to all devices while each of the other standards provides additional
    specifications for a particular device. For each device, IEEE Std C37.40-1993,
    IEEE Std C37.41-1994, plus the standard covering that device, constitute a complete
    set of standards for each device. In addition, IEEE Std C37.48-1997 is an application,
    operation, and maintenance guide for all the devices.
