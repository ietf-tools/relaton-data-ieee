abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.4(TM)-2011 specifies a PHY for use in
    equipment intended to address rail transportation industry needs and to meet US
    positive train control (PTC) regulatory requirements and similar regulatory requirements
    in other parts of the world. In addition, the amendment describes only those MAC
    changes needed to support this PHY.
