abstract:
- content: This draft recommended practice provides a set of guidelines that can be
    used by the operators of new start-up systems seeking guidance in developing manuals,
    methods, practices and procedures for the safe and effective maintenance of their
    Overhead Contact System (OCS), or by the maintenance organizations of existing
    well-established systems to amplify or refine their existing practices. This draft
    recommended practice provides general recommendations for performing maintenance
    work on dc OCS for transit systems. These recommendations are based on sound engineering
    principles, engineering safety considerations and field experience by many transit
    agencies. Included are technical explanations to cover certain testing of tools
    and equipment; field maintenance and care of tools and equipment; work methods
    for the maintenance of the OCS; and recommended safety practices and procedures
    for persons working in the vicinity of energized lines. Since local conditions
    and circumstances differ from one transit agency to the next, acceptance or rejection
    of any or all of the recommendations contained therein is left to the discretion
    of the individual agency, which should determine their applicability to its proposed
    or existing operating practices and procedures. It is not intended that the guidelines
    replace present proven transit agency procedures or that the recommended practices
    form the basis for a mandatory standard.
