abstract:
- content: Defined in this standard are a data model for describing, referencing,
    and sharing competency definitions, and frameworks of competency definitions and
    rubrics in the context of online and distributed learning and in employment and
    work. This standard provides a way to formally represent the key characteristics
    of a competency definition, independently of its use in any particular context.
    It enables interoperability among learning systems that deal with competency information
    by providing a means for them to refer to common definitions with common meanings.
