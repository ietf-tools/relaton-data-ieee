abstract:
- content: Requirements on the simulation of renewable, nuclear, and fossil-based
    energy sources are specified in this standard. These simulations aid the financing
    and management of green energy businesses. The simulation scope, simulation participants
    relationship parameters, simulation tools, simulation data type, simulation data
    format, and simulation outcome verification are specified.
