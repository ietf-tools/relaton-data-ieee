abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C57 family on Power Distribution
    and Regulating Transformers. The performance, electrical and mechanical interchangeability
    as well as the safety of the equipment are covered. The proper selection of such
    equipment is established as a basis for use in this standard. Certain electrical,
    dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are described, and certain safety
    features of three-phase, 60 Hz, low-voltage 600 V and below network protectors
    are taken into consideration. They are used for automatically connecting and disconnecting
    a network transformer from a secondary spot or grid network.
