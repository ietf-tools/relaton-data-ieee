abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. Direction is provided for the selection of monitoring and
    for diagnostic parameters to be used with high-voltage circuit breakers (i.e.,
    above 100 V). Guidance on appropriate parameters to be considered for monitoring
    applied to various circuit breaker technologies is also provided.
