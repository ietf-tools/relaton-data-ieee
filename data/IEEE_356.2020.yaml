- content: Measurements of the electrical properties of naturally occurring solids
    are covered in the scope of this guide. Not covered are methods that rely on mapping
    earth structure anomalies unless directly related to electrical properties. Coverage
    of numerical methods for forward/inverse modeling is limited.
