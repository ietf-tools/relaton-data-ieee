abstract:
- content: An architecture for the interconnection of IEEE 802(R) Local Area Networks
    (LANs) below the MAC Service boundary is defined. MAC Bridges, as specified by
    this standard, allow communications between end stations attached to separate
    LANs, each with its own separate MAC, to be transparent to logical link control
    (LLC) and network layer protocols, just as if the stations were attached to the
    same LAN.
