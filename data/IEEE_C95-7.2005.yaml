abstract:
- content: Elements of a radio frequency (RF) exposure safety program that can prevent
    or control potential risks associated with exposure to the electromagnetic fields
    from RF sources that operate in the frequency range of 3kHz to 300 GHz are described
    in this recommended practice. The means for accomplishing this are classifying
    exposure locations into one of four categories based on the potential hazard,
    as defined by exposure limits, and specifying appropriate controls for each category.
    Such controls include engineering and administrative controls as well as the use
    of personal protective equipment, placement of appropriate RF safety signage,
    designation of restricted access areas, the use of personal RF monitors, and RF
    safety awareness training. These recommendations are not intended to apply to
    the purposeful exposure of patients by or under the direction of medical practitioners,
    but can be used in the development of safety programs for medical staff and other
    persons working with or incidentally exposed to RF fields, and for those wearing
    implanted or external medical electronic devices. Although designed to complement
    IEEE Std C95.1, this recommended practice may also be used for the development
    of programs to insure conformance with IEEE Std C95.6 and with other guidelines,
    standards, or regulations for controlling human exposure to electromagnetic energy.
