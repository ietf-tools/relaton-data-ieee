abstract:
- content: Various battery systems are discussed so that the user can make informed
    decisions on selection, installation design, installation, maintenance, and testing
    of stationary standby batteries used in uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems.
    UPS battery charging and converter components relation to the selection of the
    battery systems is described. Design requirements of the UPS components are beyond
    the scope of this document. Battery back-up systems for dc-output rectifiers are
    also beyond the scope of this document.
