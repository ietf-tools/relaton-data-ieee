abstract:
- content: Performance testing of electrical energy storage (EES) system in electric
    charging stations in combination with photovoltaic (PV) is covered. General technical
    requirement of the test, the duty cycle development and characteristics are given.
    Based on these, detailed test protocol based on duty cycle, such as stored energy,
    roundtrip efficiency, step response time, ramp rate and duty cycle roundtrip efficiency,
    etc. are provided.
