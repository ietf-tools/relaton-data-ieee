abstract:
- content: In this period of transition, authors and editors of scientific and engineering
    literature sometimes need basic information on the International System of Units
    (the Metric System), described in this standard. This contains the units, supplementary
    units, and multiplier prefixes of the International System, along with instructions
    for their correct use. Numerous examples are given. Conversions between the International
    and the British-American System are also discussed, and a procedure is described
    for rounding after such conversions. Three appendixes define the International
    System base units, list conversion factors, and explain the work of the International
    Bureau of Weights and Measures.
