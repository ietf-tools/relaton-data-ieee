abstract:
- content: A physical interface for the interconnection of computers and medical devices
    in the IEEE 1073 family of standards is defined. This interface is intended to
    be highly robust in an environment where devices are frequently connected to and
    disconnected from the network. The physical and electrical characteristics of
    the connector and signals necessary to exchange digital information between cable-connected,
    medical devices and host computer systems are specified.
