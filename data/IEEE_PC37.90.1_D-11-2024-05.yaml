abstract:
- content: This standard specifies 1 design tests for relays, relay systems, and control
    devices used for Protection and Control of Electric Power Apparatus, that relate
    to the immunity of this equipment to repetitive electrical transients. Two types
    of tests are specified, the slow damped oscillatory test, and the electrical fast
    transient (EFT) burst test. For devices with communication ports, where the device
    does not perform protection or control functions, testing of the communication
    functions is covered by IEEE Std. 1613. Where the device performs protection or
    control functions and has communication ports, tests for all communication functions
    are covered by this document. For devices without communication ports, the tests
    are covered by this document.
