abstract:
- content: 'This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective
    functions of: 1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices 2) direct-acting
    overcurrent electronic trip systems 3) reverse-current trip systems 4) undervoltage
    trip devices that are integral with low-voltage ac (1000 V and below) and general-purpose
    low-voltage dc (1500 V and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE Std C37.13,
    and IEEE Std C37.14. Additional information, communication and/or additional internal
    or external protective functions or devices are not covered by this standard.
    This standard should not be interpreted to restrict the inclusion of such functionality
    in the device.'
