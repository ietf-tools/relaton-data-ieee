abstract:
- content: The increasing variety of speech transmission systems has created a new
    problem for communication engineers. This problem consists of the subjective evaluation
    of the speech quality produced by these systems. For investigators interested
    only in the utilization of some procedure applicable to this problem, it was difficult
    to make a choice among the wide range of documented approaches. The IEEE Audio
    and Electroacoustics Group therefore formed a Subcommittee on Subjective Measurements,
    which has been charged with writing a Recommended Practice for speech quality
    measurement. The intent of the Subcommittee became to write a document that would
    facilitate the choice of method by reducing the variety of procedures to several
    which had been successful and looked promising for the future, and which could
    handle a variety of signals. By describing these methods in some detail, it would
    be possible for different laboratories to obtain comparable results and thus aid
    in the exchange of information. Because of the relatively early stage of the development
    of speech quality evaluation, the present document is intended to be a Recommended
    Practice, but not a long term standard, which would require speech quality measurement
    only according to the proposed methods. It is hoped that the document will generate
    additional investigation into problems of this type of measurement, and allow
    comparison of test data obtained in different laboratories. Thus, a body of experimental
    data may be generated that will be useful to future investigations as well as
    the improvement of the present practices. The Subcommittee expects that feedback
    from users of the practices will allow the revision and updating of the practices
    within a relatively short time period. It should be pointed out that the present
    practices evaluate only speech signals as they are generated by one-way speech
    communication systems. Systems, especially two-way systems, in which interactive
    communication takes place, cannot validly be evaluated by these methods. One of
    the directions, therefore, in which these practices might be updated in the future
    is by adding material on the evaluation of communications systems. It is the hope
    of the Subcommittee that the present document will be helpful in some way to people
    confronted with the task of making speech quality measurements. In order to guide
    its future work, the Subcommittee would appreciate that any technical comments
    about the usefulness of the documents, or any other comments or information about
    speech quality measurement, be sent to its Chairman, c/o the IEEE Audio and Electroacoustics
    Group, IEEE Headquarters.
