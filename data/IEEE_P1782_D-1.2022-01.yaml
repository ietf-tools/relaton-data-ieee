abstract:
- content: Electric power system reliability remains an important societal issue.
    Transmission disturbances draw national attention and scrutiny, but service interruptions
    at the distribution level are the primary concern of end-use customers and their
    regulatory and governmental representatives. Much effort has been expended on
    developing methods to uniformly and consistently quantify the reliability of distribution
    service based on distribution grid’s performance. This guide discusses the collection,
    categorization, and use of information related to electric power distribution
    interruption events. This guide, when used in combination with Institute of Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers Std 1366, promotes consistency in how the industry collects
    data for the purpose of benchmarking distribution system performance
