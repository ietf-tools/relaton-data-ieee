abstract:
- content: This document is a companion to Technical Committee Report on Recommended
    Practices for Burst Measurements in the Time Domain, IEEE No. 257, May 1964. In
    the time domain document, bursts are defined and particular attention is placed
    on their duration and magnitude. The use of additional characteristics may prove
    desirable when investigating both cause and effect of a burst. Mathematical transformations
    have been widely used to bring out particular characteristics of signals. Perhaps
    the one most commonly used is the Fourier Transform, which defines the spectrum
    of signals. The energy density spectrum of a burst, a quantity derived from the
    Fourier Transform, is the subject of this report. Other transformations such as
    those of Hilbert or Henkel, may be used to display different characteristics of
    a burst but they will not be considered here. Sampling the energy density spectrum
    is the key concept of this document. It constitutes the basis by which this spectrum
    can be characterized comprehensively by a practical number of measurements. The
    sampling theorems in the frequency domain are, therefore, given detailed consideration
    in Appendices to the extent necessary for understanding the measurement methods
    to be discussed.
