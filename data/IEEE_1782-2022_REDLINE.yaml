abstract:
- content: Electric power system reliability remains an important societal issue.
    Transmission disturbances draw national attention and scrutiny, but service interruptions
    at the distribution level are the primary concern of end-use customers and their
    regulatory and governmental representatives. Much effort has been expended on
    developing methods to uniformly and consistently quantify the reliability of distribution
    service based on the distribution grid’s performance. The collection, categorization,
    and use of information related to electric power distribution interruption events
    are discussed in this guide. When combined with IEEE Std 1366, consistency in
    how the industry collects data for the purpose of benchmarking distribution system
    performance, is achieved.
