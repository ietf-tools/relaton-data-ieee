abstract:
- content: This standard establishes a common framework for describing the life cycle
    of systems created by humans. It defines a set of processes and associated terminology.
    These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system's structure.
    Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for
    managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle. This is accomplished
    through the involvement of all interested parties with the ultimate goal of achieving
    customer satisfaction. This standard is identical with ISO/IEC 15288:2002 but
    contains an additional informative annex, Annex E, explaining the relationship
    of this standard to other IEEE standards
