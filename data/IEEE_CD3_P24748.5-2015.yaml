abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748 provides unified and consolidated guidance on the life
    cycle management of systems and software. It draws on key aspects of the former
    IEEE J-Std-016 Standard for information technology software - Software life cycle
    processes - Software development - Acquirer-supplier agreement. The IEEE Standards
    Association has identified the need for a non-military standard to guide managers
    of software systems in software development planning.Taken together, the parts
    of ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748are intended to facilitate the joint usage of the process
    content of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, Systems and software engineering
    - System life cycle processes, which in turn may be used together with related
    standards such as for service management,and various lower-level process standards.
