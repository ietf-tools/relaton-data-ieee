abstract:
- content: Multi-point mobile grounding system plays a critical role in providing
    safer power supply for electrified railway as the unique pathway of traction power
    reflux. The multi-point mobile grounding system of electrified railway contains
    two types of grounding modes--working grounding and protective grounding. However,
    along with the traction power increasing, it is possible that the traction current
    discharged by the working grounding flows through the neighboring protective grounding
    points and back to the vehicle bodies. This vehicle body (VB) current may flee
    through other protective grounding points back to the rail again during the dynamic
    process of the vehicles, forming as the current reflux phenomenon. This VB current
    reflux may directly result in thermal surge in the partial part of train bodies,
    or cause the contact potential of vehicle bodies, which may interfere or even
    burn the low-voltage control systems or on-board sensors. Apart from threatening
    the on-board equipment, the uneven distribution of reflux locating at each wheel
    set of carriage may also result in the erosion of the isolated joint of rail or
    even shorten the life span of carbon brush contacting with the axles of grounding
    wheels. The design and requirement of grounding system for vehicles operation
    in electrified railway is applied in this guide.
