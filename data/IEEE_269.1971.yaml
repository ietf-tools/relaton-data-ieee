abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to describe a practical method for measuring
    the transmission characteristics of a telephone set by means of objective measurements
    in a test connection. The test results thus obtained may be used as a means of
    evaluating or specifying the transmission performance of a telephone on a standardized
    basis. The basic accuracy and reproducibility of measurements made in accordance
    with this standard will depend primarily upon the accuracy of the test equipment
    used, the care with which the measurements are conducted, and the inherent stability
    of the telephone and/or transducers under test. Where a given set of measurements
    is repeated in the same laboratory and by the same operator, a relatively high
    degree of reproducibility should normally be obtained. However, when comparing
    measurements made by different laboratories, allowances must be made for the influencing
    factors mentioned above.

- content: 'The methods that are used to measure telephone-set transmission performance
    may be divided into two classes: objective methods and subjective methods. The
    objective methods, which are those to be discussed in this standard, utilize a
    sound source resembling the human mouth to drive the transmitter, and a simple
    air volume resembling that of the human ear as a termination for the receiver.
    The sound source comprises a source of electrical energy and a moving-coil loudspeaker
    unit having supplementary electrical and acoustical components that provide a
    sound field similar to that produced by a typical human voice. This special loudspeaker
    is referred to as an Artificial Mouth. The terminating air volume, in which the
    sound pressure generated by the receiver is measured, is provided by a device
    referred to as an Artificial Ear. The Artificial Mouth and Ear are useful in comparing
    the performance of telephone sets at frequencies in the significant portion of
    the speech range.'
