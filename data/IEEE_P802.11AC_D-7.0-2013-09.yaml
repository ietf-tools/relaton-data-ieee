abstract:
- content: The purpose of this amendment is to improve the IEEE 802.11(tm) wireless
    local area network (WLAN) user experience by providing significantly higher basic
    service set (BSS)throughput for existing WLAN application areas and to enable
    new market segments for operation below 6 GHz including distribution of multiple
    multimedia/data streams.
