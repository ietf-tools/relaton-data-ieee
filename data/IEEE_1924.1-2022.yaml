abstract:
- content: A set of guidelines is presented in this recommended practice for the development
    of energy-efficient and power-proportional digital architectures so that energy
    is only consumed when computations are under way and energy is reduced in the
    non-operating state. The purpose of this practice is to provide guidelines for
    the designers and developers of digital architectures for creating power-proportionality
    at different levels of the system.
