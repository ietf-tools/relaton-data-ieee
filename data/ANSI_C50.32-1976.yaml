abstract:
- content: Useful methods for the evaluation of systems of insulation for random-wound
    stators of rotating electric machines are given. The chief purpose is to classify
    insulation systems in accordance with their temperature limits by test, rather
    than by chemical composition. The procedure is intended to evaluate insulation
    systems for use in usual service conditions with air cooling. It has also been
    a useful tool for evaluating systems for special requirements where machines are
    enclosed in gas atmospheres, subjected to strong chemicals, metal dusts, or submersion
    in liquids, although these special requirements are beyond the scope of this test
    procedure.
