abstract:
- content: 'High Level Architecture (HLA)-Object Model Template (OMT) specification
    defines the format and syntax (but not content) of HLA object models. Simulations
    are abstractions of the real world, and no one simulation can solve all of the
    functional needs for the modeling and simulation community. It is anticipated
    that advances in technology will allow for new and different modeling and simulation
    (M&amp;S) implementations within the framework of the HLA. The standards contained
    in this architecture are interrelated and need to be considered as a product set,
    as a change in one is likely to have an impact on the others. As such, the HLA
    is an integrated approach that has been developed to provide a common architecture
    for simulation. Keywords: architecture, class attribute, data distribution management,
    federate, federation, federation execution, federation object model, framework,
    High Level Architecture, instance attribute, instance attribute ownership, interaction
    class, joined federate, object class, object model template, rules, runtime infrastructure,
    simulation object model, time-constrained, time-regulating.'
