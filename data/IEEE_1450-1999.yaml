abstract:
- content: 'Standard Test Interface Language (STIL) provides an interface between
    digital test generation tools and test equipment. A test description language
    is defined that: (a) facilitates the transfer of digital test vector data from
    CAE to ATE environments; (b) specifies pattern, format, and timing information
    sufficient to define the application of digital test vectors to a DUT; and (c)
    supports the volume of test vector data generated from structured tests.'
