abstract:
- content: The purpose is to establish the general performance criteria for terrestrial
    photovoltaic power systems and to provide an overall framework for all detailed
    terrestrial photovoltaic power system performance standards. It also provides
    recommendations for criteria regarding subsystem performance and standard test
    methods to be used for performance measurements. Since thermal conditioning elements
    may be part of the system design, some consideration of the thermal subsystem
    is included.<<ETX>>
