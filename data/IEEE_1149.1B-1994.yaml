abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1149.1-2001 A language to describe components that conform
    to IEEE Std 1149.1-1990 is described in this supplement. The language is based
    on the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). General characteristics, the
    overall structure of a boundary-scan description language (BSDL) description,
    special cases, and example packages are included.
