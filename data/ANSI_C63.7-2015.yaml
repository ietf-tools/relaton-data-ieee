abstract:
- content: Information that is useful in constructing test sites used to perform radiated
    emission measurements in the frequency range of 30 MHz to 18 GHz is provided.
    Final validity of a test site can only be determined by performing normalized
    site attenuation and/or site voltage standing-wave ratio measurements as described
    in ANSI C63.4.
