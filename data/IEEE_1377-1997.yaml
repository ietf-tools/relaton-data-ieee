abstract:
- content: Functionally related utility application data elements, grouped into a
    single data structure for transport are described. Data may be utilized peer-to-peer
    or upstream to readers or billing systems by being carried by one lower layered
    protocol to another stack of lower layered protocol. The data structure does not
    change from end device to the user of the data.
