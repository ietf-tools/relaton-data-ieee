abstract:
- content: This supplement specifies the changes required to ANSI/IEEE Std 802.5,
    1998 Edition, (Base standard) and ANSI/IEEE 802.5r, 1998 Edition, and ANSI/IEEE
    Std 802.5j, 1998 Edition, (Amendment 1 standard) to support 100 Mbit/s Dedicated
    Token Ring (DTR) operation. The Base standard, together with the Amendment 1 standard,
    specifies shared and dedicated (point-to-point) Token Ring operation at both 4
    Mbit/s and 16 Mbit/s using either the TKP Access Protocol or the TXI Access Protocol.
    This supplement extends Token Ring operation to 100 Mbit/s for the DTR CPort and
    Station using the TXI Access Protocol. Extensions to the medium access control
    (MAC) have been made to accommodate the requirements for high media rates (100
    Mbit/s and above).
