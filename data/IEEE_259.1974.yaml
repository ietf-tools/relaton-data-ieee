abstract:
- content: A uniform method by which the thermal endurance of electrical insulation
    systems for dry-type specialty and general-purpose transformers can be compared
    is established. These insulation systems are intended for use in the types of
    transformers described in NEMA ST 1-1988 and NEMA ST 20-1992.
