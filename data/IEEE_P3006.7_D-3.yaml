abstract:
- content: Methods for determining the reliability of 724 continuous power systems
    in industrial and commercial facilities are described in this recommended practice.
    The method of reliability analysis by probability methods is described first.
    This is followed by a discussion of how to evaluate the results and how to implement
    changes to ensure that the expected degree of reliability is achieved.
