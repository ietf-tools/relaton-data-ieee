abstract:
- content: 'The standard defines an abstraction layer for multiple home networking
    technologies. The abstraction layer provides a common data and control Service
    Access Point to the heterogeneous home networking technologies described in the
    following specifications: IEEE P1901, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.3 and MoCA 1.1. The
    standard is extendable to work with other home networking technologies.The abstraction
    layer supports dynamic interface selection for transmission of packets arriving
    from any interface (upper protocol layers or underlying network technologies).
    End-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) is supported.Also specified are procedures,
    protocols and guidelines to provide a simplified user experience to add devices
    to the network, to set up encryption keys, to extend the network coverage, and
    to provide network management features to address issues related to neighbor discovery,
    topology discovery, path selection, QoS negotiation, and network control and management.'
