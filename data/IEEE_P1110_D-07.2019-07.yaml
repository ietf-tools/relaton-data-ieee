abstract:
- content: Categorized in this guide are three direct-axis and four quadrature-axis
    models, along with the basic transient reactance model. Also discussed are some
    of the assumptions made in using various models. The fundamental equations and
    concepts involved in generator/system interfacing are presented. Covered, generally,
    are the various attributes of power system stability, recognizing two basic approaches.
    The first is categorized under large disturbance nonlinear analysis; the second
    approach considers small disturbances, where the corresponding dynamic equations
    are linearized. Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and
    treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies,
    both in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance
    stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived,
    whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different
    saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power
    angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared. The question
    of parameter determination or verification is covered. Two approaches in accounting
    for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion
    factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another for
    correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions for modeling
    of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities are included.
