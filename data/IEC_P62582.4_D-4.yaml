abstract:
- content: This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 specifies methods for condition monitoring
    of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using
    oxidation induction techniques in the detail necessary to produce accurate and
    reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements for sample preparation,
    the measurement system and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results.
