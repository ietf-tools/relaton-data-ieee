abstract:
- content: A step-by-step process for selecting an appropriate termination that is
    commensurate with a particular shielded power cable design is provided in this
    guide. Over the years, shielded power cables have been developed that employ many
    different insulating materials and many different shielding systems, such that,
    there are numerous issues to consider when selecting a termination for a particular
    cable design. Over the same period of time, many different termination methods
    and designs have been developed that serve the same purpose, but employ different
    application methodologies. This guide does not attempt to cover every cable and
    termination design, and is generally restricted to single conductor underground
    residential distribution (URD) and shielded power cable that have a voltage rating
    from 5 kV 46 kV, which includes some industrial cables. By nature, the terminations
    referred to in this guide are considered to be "live front," in that the terminations
    comprise a transition from a shielded power cable system to an energized component
    or bus that is either bare or simply covered.
