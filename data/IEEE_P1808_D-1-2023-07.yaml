abstract:
- content: Reference information to assist electric utilities and their contractors
    with the development of computer-based means for collecting and managing transmission
    line inspection and maintenance data and associated asset information is provided.
    The guide provides a high level overview of key principles and considerations
    learned through experience that helps ensure common pitfalls are avoided and enhance
    the usability of systems and collected data. It is not intended to provide an
    exhaustive discussion of the many details and specifics that shall be accounted
    for when designing and developing a system including data requirements for an
    individual utility’s application and needs.
