abstract:
- content: Superseded by 400-2001. Procedures and recommended test voltage values
    for acceptance and maintenance high-direct-voltage testing of shielded power cable
    systems are set forth. They apply to all types of shielded, insulated power cable.
    The aim is to provide uniform test procedures and guidelines for evaluation of
    the test results. This guide is not intended to apply to unshielded power cables,
    communication cables, control cables, high-frequency cables, or other special-purpose
    cables, nor does it purport to require that testing be performed, either at the
    time of installation or maintenance.
