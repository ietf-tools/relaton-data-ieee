abstract:
- content: Uniform minimum acceptable requirements for the performance of reliability
    analyses for safety-related systems found in nuclear power generating stations
    are provided. The requirements can be applied during design, fabrication, testing,
    maintenance, and repair of systems and components in nuclear power plants. The
    timing of the analysis depends upon the purpose for which it is performed.
