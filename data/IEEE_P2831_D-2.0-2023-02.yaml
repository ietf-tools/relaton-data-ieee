abstract:
- content: The category and composition, technical requirements, test methods, inspection
    rules, marking, packing, transportation, storage, and installation of distributed
    traveling wave fault location devices for high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission
    lines are detailed. This recommended practice is applicable to distributed traveling
    wave fault location devices for HVDC transmission lines and alternating current
    (ac) transmission lines.
