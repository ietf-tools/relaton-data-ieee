abstract:
- content: 'This document provides in compact form recommendations and technical reasons
    for the selection, design and application of aircraft electric power systems and
    electrically-actuated load equipment, without going into specific detailed designs.
    The standard was originally published in 1960 as AIEE 750. Sections of this guide
    are: introduction; criteria for the electric system; characteristics of alternating-current
    generators affecting their application; distribution system design; symmetrical
    components; principal subdivisions of electric system; selection of the system;
    installation practices; equipment characteristics; and electric system design
    procedures.<<ETX>>'
