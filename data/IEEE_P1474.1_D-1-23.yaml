abstract:
- content: Performance and functional requirements for a communications-based train
    control (CBTC) system are established in this standard. A CBTC system is a continuous,
    automatic train control system utilizing high-resolution train location determination,
    independent of track circuits; continuous, high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside
    data communications; and train-borne and wayside processors capable of implementing
    automatic train protection (ATP) functions, as well as optional automatic train
    operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions. In addition to
    CBTC functional requirements, this standard also defines headway criteria, system
    safety criteria, and system availability criteria for a CBTC system. This standard
    is applicable to the full range of transit applications including automated people
    movers. This standard establishes a set of performance and functional requirements
    necessary for enhancing performance, availability, operations, and train protection
    using a CBTC System.
