abstract:
- content: This standard covers metal-enclosed interrupter switchgear assemblies containing
    but not limited to such devices as interrupter/switches, selector switches, power
    fuses, control, instrumentation and metering, and protective equipment. It includes,
    but is not specifically limited to, equipment for the control and protection of
    apparatus used for distribution of electrical power. This standard is concerned
    with enclosed, rather than open, switchgear assemblies rated above 1000 V. It
    includes equipments that are part of primary and secondary unit substations. It
    does not include gas insulated substation equipments, nor switching devices mounted
    integrally within a transformer enclosure. In this standard the metal-enclosed
    interrupter switchgear shall be called MEI switchgear.
