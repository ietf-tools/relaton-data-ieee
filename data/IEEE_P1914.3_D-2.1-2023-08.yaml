abstract:
- content: The encapsulation and mapping of radio protocols transported over Ethernet
    frames and Internet Protocol (IP) packets and the operation of the mappers and
    de-mappers are defined in this standard. Structure-agnostic definitions are provided
    for any digitized radio data. Structure-aware definitions are provided for the
    Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI&#8482;). Native mode definitions are provided
    for normal and compressed digitized radio in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) payload.
    Specifications are provided for parameters, control messages, and mechanisms that
    help operate, administrate, and maintain the mapping and demapping functions.
    A management model and a YANG data model are defined.
