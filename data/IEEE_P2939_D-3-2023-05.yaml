abstract:
- content: This guide identifies the mechanisms and an analytic approach for developing
    consistent rules, agreements, and/or methodologies for the evaluation and inter-entity
    cooperation managing pole attachments on utility infrastructure that can contain
    both electric supply as well as communications wireline and wireless facilities.
    The common safety codes and accepted good industry practices for joint use are
    referenced, including items such as clearances and strength/loading requirements,
    appropriate work rules during installation, maintenance and restoration, and general
    guidelines. The considerations within this guide can be used to help perform a
    detailed assessment of attachment installations where communications antennas
    and related wireline and wireless equipment are to be co-located on joint use
    structures.
