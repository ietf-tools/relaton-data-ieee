abstract:
- content: A set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that is aimed at breaking
    down the barriers between different deep learning (DL) inference engines and applications
    is defined in this standard. The APIs are comprised of functional interfaces including
    parameter reading, model compilation optimization, operator registration, thread
    management, input/output data acquisition, inference instance creation, and inference
    execution.
