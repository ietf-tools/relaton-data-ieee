abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Feb 07, 2003. No longer endorsed by
    the IEEE. This standard is part of a family of standards for local area networks
    (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs) that deal with the Physical and Data
    Link Layers as defined by the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model.
    It defines a high-speed shared medium access protocol for use over a dual, counterflowing,
    unidirectional bus subnetwork. The Physical Layer and Distributed Queue Dual Bus
    (DQDB) Layer are required to support a Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer by
    means of a connectionless Medium Access Control (MAC) Sublayer service in a manner
    consistent with other IEEE 902 networks. Additional DQDB Layer functions are specified
    as a framework for other services. These additional functions will support Isochronous
    Service Users and Connection-Oriented Data Service users, but their implementation
    is not required for conformance.'
