abstract:
- content: This guide defines guidelines for knowledge graphs (KGs) in electric-power
    fields. The guide specifies data and schema requirements, an Electric-Power-Oriented
    KG construction process, KG integration, performance evaluation and application
    scenarios. This guide helps institutions and enterprises that develop KGs in the
    electric-power field follow a general implementation method. In addition, it may
    help the suppliers provide compatible KGs under the unified power knowledge model
    and interface specifications. With this guide, electric-power KGs can be simply
    and efficiently combined and integrated, forming a more complete and accurate
    knowledge service ecosystem in the power industry.
