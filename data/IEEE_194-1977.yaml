abstract:
- content: 'This standard provides fundamental definitions for general use in time
    domain pulse technology. It defines terms for pulse phenomena and pulse parameters
    which are prerequisite to: efficient communication of technical information; standards
    for methods of pulse parameter measurement; standards for pulse apparatus; and
    standards for apparatus which employs pulse techniques. With its scope, the object
    of this standard is the definition of an internally consistent, mathematically
    rigorous, and general set of pulse terms which are applicable to: hypothetical
    and practical pulses regardless of accuracy or precision; to a wide range of technologies
    and disciplines; and, in a measurement situation, regardless of the means of measurement
    or the means for waveform evaluation employed.<<ETX>>'
