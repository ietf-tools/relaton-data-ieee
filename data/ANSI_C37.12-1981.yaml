abstract:
- content: These specifications apply to all indoor and outdoor types of ac high-voltage
    circuit breakers rated above 1000 volts. This document is issued only as a guide
    for use in compiling specifications for ac high-voltage circuit breakers. The
    imperative mode of the language is illustrative of that used in specifications.
    It does not imply that this document is anything other than advisory in its scope.
