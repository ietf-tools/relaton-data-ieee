abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to establish a common language for describing
    functional tests of memory devices. That language definition includes the vocabulary
    and grammar necessary to specify the functional testing of memory devices. The
    language is intended to be used as a general descriptive language rather than
    one for programming a tester. As a result, the grammar and syntax are defined
    in a looser and more general way than would be required for a programming language.
