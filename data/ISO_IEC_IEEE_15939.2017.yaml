abstract:
- content: This document provides an elaboration of the measurement process from ISO/IEC
    15288 and ISO/IEC 12207. The measurement process is applicable to system and software
    engineering and management disciplines. The process is described through a model
    that defines the activities of the measurement process that are required to adequately
    specify what measurement information is required, how the measures and analysis
    results are to be applied, and how to determine if the analysis results are valid.
    The measurement process is flexible, tailorable, and adaptable to the needs of
    different users. This document identifies a process that supports defining a suitable
    set of measures that address specific information needs. It identifies the activities
    and tasks that are necessary to successfully identify, define, select, apply,
    and improve measurement within an overall project or organizational measurement
    structure. It also provides definitions for commonly used measurement terms.
