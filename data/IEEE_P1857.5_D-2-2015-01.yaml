abstract:
- content: Multimedia data has become the majority of data flooding the Internet.This
    standard defines a set of tools to support specific audio coding functions including
    ACELP/TVC compression, bandwidth extension, stereo coding, frame erasure concealment,
    etc. The tool set defined in this standard provides high quality and efficient
    coding tool sets for compression, decompression, processing, and representation
    of speech, music or mixed audio signals to save transmission bandwidth and storage
    space. The target applications and services include but not limited to mobile
    communication, wireless broadband multimedia communications, internet broadband
    streaming media service and applications.
