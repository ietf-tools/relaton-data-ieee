abstract:
- content: The purpose of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards
    is to define an internationally-agreed set of standards for software testing that
    can be used by any organization when performing any form of software testing.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2 comprises test process descriptions that define the software
    testing processes at the organizational level, test management level and dynamic
    test levels. It supports dynamic testing, functional and non-functional testing,
    manual and automated testing, and scripted and unscripted testing. The processes
    defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2 can be used in conjunction with any software development
    lifecycle model. Since testing is a key approach to risk-mitigation in software
    development, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2 follows a risk-based approach to testing. Risk-based
    testing is a common industry approach to strategizing and managing testing. Risk-based
    testing allows testing to be prioritized and focused on the most important features
    and functions.
