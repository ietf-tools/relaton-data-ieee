abstract:
- content: Procedures for the measurement of electric and magnetic fields in close
    proximity to video display terminals (VDTs) in the frequency range of 5 Hz to
    400 kHz are provided. Existing international measurement technologies and practices
    are adapted to achieve a consistent and harmonious VDT measurement standard for
    testing in a laboratory controlled environment.
