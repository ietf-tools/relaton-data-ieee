abstract:
  content: 'Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard defines a common framework for making an abstract
    model of personal health data available in transport-independent transfer syntax
    required to establish logical connections between systems and to provide presentation
    capabilities and services needed to perform communication tasks. The protocol
    is optimized to personal health usage requirements and leverages commonly used
    methods and tools wherever possible. This corrigendum removes the ambiguities
    and corrects the wrong nomenclature codes and qualifier status that have been
    identified in IEEE Std 11073-20601-2014 to improve implementation of the standard
    in an interoperable fashion. (NOTE: This amendment was not published as an individual
    standard, but was incorporated into ISO/IEEE 11073-20601:2010 at time of publication)'
