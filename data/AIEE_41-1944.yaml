abstract:
- content: These standards comprise a manual of test procedures to be followed in
    making tests to determine the characteristics of insulators to be used on electric
    power systems. They are not intended to include test procedure for apparatus bushings.
    Since these standards are not intended to be insulator specifications, the individual
    tests may be made a part of an insulator specification only when specifically
    designated in contract specifications. In all cases where these standards include
    high voltage measurements, the methods, equipment, and technique shall be in accordance
    with American Standards for Measurement of Test Voltage in Dielectric Tests, C68.1-1942
    or latest revision thereof.
