abstract:
- content: This document, the IEEE 1505.1 Common Test Interface Pin Map Configuration
    for High-Density, Single-Tier Electronics Test Requirements Utilizing IEEE Standard
    1505 represents an extension to the IEEE-1505 Receiver Fixture Interface (RFI)
    Standard Specifications. Particular emphasis is placed on defining within the
    IEEE-1505 RFI Standard a more specific set of performance requirements that employ
    a common scalable (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific connector modules; (c)
    respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation; and (e) legacy
    ATE transitional devices. This is intentionally done to standardize the footprint
    and assure mechanical and electrical interoperability between past and future
    Automatic Test Systems (ATS).
