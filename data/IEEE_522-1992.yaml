abstract:
- content: 'Suggestions are made for testing the dielectric strength of the insulation
    separating the various turns from each other within multiturn form-wound coils
    to determine their acceptability. Typical ratings of machines employing such coils
    normally lie within the range of 200 kW to 100 MW. The test voltage levels described
    do not evaluate the ability of the turn insulation to withstand abnormal voltage
    surges, as contrasted to surges associated with normal operation. The suggestions
    apply to: (1) individual stator coils after manufacture; (2) coils in completely
    wound stators of original manufacture; (3) coils and windings for rewinds of used
    machinery; and (4) windings of machines in service to determine their suitability
    for further service (preventive-maintenance testing). Coil service conditions,
    test devices, and test sequence are discussed. High-frequency test levels for
    new coils during winding, and for applying surge tests to complete windings, are
    given.'
