abstract:
- content: The application of metal-oxide surge arresters to safeguard electric power
    equipment against the hazards of abnormally high voltage surges of various origins
    is covered. Step-by step directions toward proper solutions of various applications
    are provided. In many cases, the prescribed steps are adequate. More complex and
    special solutions requiring study by experienced engineers are described, but
    specific solutions are not always given. The procedures are based on theoretical
    studies, test results, and experience.
