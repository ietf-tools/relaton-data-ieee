abstract:
- content: Superseded by C37.99-1990. IEEE Guide for the Protection of Shunt Capacitor
    Banks, assists in the effective application of relays and other devices for the
    protection of shunt capacitors used in substations. It covers the protective considerations,
    along with recommended and alternate methods of protection for the most commonly
    used capacitor bank configurations. Capacitor bank design trade-offs are also
    discussed. This guide covers protection of filter tanks and very large EHV capacitor
    banks, but does not include a discussion of pole-mounted capacitor banks on distribution
    circuits or application of capacitors connected to rotating apparatus.
