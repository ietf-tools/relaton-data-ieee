abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 1512-2006. This standard will be a base standard
    for Incident Management message sets which will be used by all response and/or
    dispatch centers such that the exchange of information will be standard and produce
    the needed responses(s). This standard will be limited to the common incident
    management message sets for use by emergency management centers. This project
    shall include the necessary research and compiling, analyzing, and the consolidation
    of the results into message sets for Incident Management communications.
