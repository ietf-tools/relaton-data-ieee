abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    (POC) and personal health devices (PHD) medical device communication (MDC), this
    standard provides the nomenclature that supports both the domain information model
    and service model components of the standards family, as well as the semantic
    content exchanged with medical devices. The nomenclature is specialized for patient
    vital signs information representation and medical device informatics, with major
    areas including concepts for electrocardiograph (ECG), haemodynamics, respiration,
    blood gas, urine, fluid-related metrics, and neurology, as well as specialized
    units of measurement, general device events, alarms, and body sites. The standard
    defines both the architecture and major components of the nomenclature, along
    with extensive definitions for each conceptual area.
