abstract:
- content: This guide presents practical line current differential schemes using digital
    communication. Operating principles, synchronization methods, channel requirements,
    current transformer requirements, external time reference requirements, backup
    considerations, testing considerations and troubleshooting are included. It also
    provides specific guidelines for various application aspects including multi-terminal
    lines, series compensated lines, mutual coupled lines, line charging current,
    in-zone transformers and reactors, single-pole tripping and reclosing as well
    as channel and external time sources requirements.
