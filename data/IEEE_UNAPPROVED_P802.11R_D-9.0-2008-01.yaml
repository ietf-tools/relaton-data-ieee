abstract:
- content: The scope of this project are enhancements to the 802.11 Medium Access
    Control (MAC) layer to minimize or eliminate the amount of time data connectivity
    between the Station (STA) and the Distribution System (DS) is absent during a
    Basic Service Set (BSS) transition, limited to the state necessary for the operation
    of the MAC. This Project Authorization Request (PAR) will apply only to the STA<->Access
    Point (AP) state within the same Extended Service Set (ESS), and will not apply
    to the Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) case. Security must not be decreased
    as a result of the enhancement. Timing criteria and timing conditions will be
    defined by the Task Group. (See also section 7.4)
