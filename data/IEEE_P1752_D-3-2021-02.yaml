abstract:
- content: Mobile and wearable devices are being increasingly developed for health
    care purposes. Mobile health (mHealth) data encompasses personal health data collected
    from sensors and mobile applications. Standardizing mHealth data and metadata
    will improve the ease and alignment accuracy of aggregating data across multiple
    mobile health sources (semantic interoperability) and will reduce the costs of
    using this data for biomedical discovery, improving health, and managing disease.
    Specifications for standardized representations of quantitative sleep and physical
    activity measures, minimum metadata, and subjective reports (surveys) are defined
    by this IEEE 1752.1 standard. The purpose of this standard is the providing of
    standard semantics to enable meaningful description, exchange, sharing, and use
    of such mHealth data. Data and associated metadata complying to this standard
    will be sufficiently clear and complete to support their use for a broad set of
    consumer health, biomedical research, and clinical care needs.
