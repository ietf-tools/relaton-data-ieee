abstract:
  content: Design information for the methods historically and typically applied by
    substation designers to minimize direct lightning strokes to equipment and buswork
    within substations is provided. Two approaches, the classical empirical method
    and the electrogeometric model, are presented in detail. A third approach involving
    the use of active lightning terminals is also briefly reviewed.
