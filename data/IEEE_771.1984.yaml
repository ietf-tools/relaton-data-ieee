abstract:
- content: This guide has mainly been written as an applications manual for engineers
    and authors who will be writing test procedures in ATLAS. The beginning chapters
    are also intended to provide managers with a brief introduction to the application
    of ATLAS in their organizations.This guide is not, in any way, intended to be
    a substitute for an instruction manual in the ATLAS language, but, rather, a practical
    extension to such a manual.It has been assumed that this guide will prove most
    useful to those engineers who are preparing test requirements in ATLAS. The cross
    referencing, therefore, between this guide and ANSI/IEEE Std 416-1984 has been
    confined to the classical definitions presented in ANSI/IEEE Std 416-1984. Appropriate
    cross references are included in parentheses following section headings, and unless
    otherwise stated, they relate to ANSI/IEEE Std 416-1984.
