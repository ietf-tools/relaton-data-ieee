abstract:
- content: Uniform criteria and guidelines for laboratory measurement and reporting
    of fly ash resistivity data obtained in the laboratory are presented. Fly ashes
    produced from the burning of any rank of coal are covered. Methods for ashing
    core bore samples of coal that have not been burned previously in a full-scale
    boiler are considered.
