abstract:
- content: The methods and conditions for seismic qualification of protective relays
    and auxiliaries such as test and control switches, terminal blocks, and indicating
    lamps for use in nuclear facilities are described in this standard. The primary
    intent of this standard is to focus on fragility testing and seismic qualification,
    also known as proof testing (either to generic levels or specific levels). Relays
    used in nuclear facilities are covered in this standard, but it may also be applied
    to any area in which the seismic response of relays is a design consideration.
    The prerequisites for the seismic test are defined in IEEE Std C37.105&#8482;.
