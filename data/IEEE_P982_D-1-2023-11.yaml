abstract:
- content: This document provides definitions, sample requirements, formulas, and
    guidance for data collection and analysis necessary to make consistent and actionable
    measurements of a software system’s reliability, availability, supportability,
    and recoverability. These characteristics collectively define the dependability
    of software systems.
