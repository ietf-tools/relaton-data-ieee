abstract:
- content: The purposes of this standard are (1) to standardize the measurement procedures
    and electrical test values for two circuits that are often used to match and grade
    magnetic cores intended for use in magnetic amplifiers and (2) to standardize
    the magnetic test values used to secure basic magnetic data on core materials.
