abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies modifications to the IEEE Std 802.11 medium access
    control (MAC) sublayer mechanisms to preserve the existing services that might
    otherwise be restricted in environments where STAs in an extended service set
    (ESS) use randomized or changing MAC addresses, without affecting the privacy
    of the users corresponding to the STAs. User privacy includes exposure of trackable
    information to third parties or exposure of an individual’s presence of behavior.
    This amendment introduces mechanisms to enable session continuity in the absence
    of unique MAC address-to-STA mapping. For STAs in an ESS that use randomized or
    changing MAC addresses, this amendment preserves the ability to provide customer
    support, conduct network diagnostics and troubleshooting, and detect device arrival
    in a trusted environment
