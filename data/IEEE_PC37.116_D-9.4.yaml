abstract:
- content: To provide a guide for the application of protective relays on transmission-line
    series capacitor banks. The guide will provide alternative approaches to the design,
    testing, and maintenance of protective relays based on the latest knowledge and
    the application experience of the industry. The guide will also cover issues related
    to the reliability of the protective relay system.
