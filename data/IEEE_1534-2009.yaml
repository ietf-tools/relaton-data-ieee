- content: Recommended practices for specifying thyristor-controlled series capacitor
    (TCSC) installations used in series with transmission lines are provided. Ratings
    for TCSC thyristor valve assemblies, capacitors, and reactors as well as TCSC
    control characteristics, protective features, cooling systems, testing, commissioning,
    training, documentation, operation, and maintenance are addressed.
