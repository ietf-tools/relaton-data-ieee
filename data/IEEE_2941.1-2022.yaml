abstract:
- content: A set of operator interfaces frequently used in artificial intelligence
    (AI) applications is defined in this standard, where the AI operators refer to
    the standard building blocks and primitives for performing basic AI operations.
    The functionality and the specific input and output operands of an AI operator
    are discussed, as well as both generality and efficiency. Various types of operators,
    such as those related to basic mathematics, neural network, and machine learning,
    are highlighted.
