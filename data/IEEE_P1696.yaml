abstract:
- content: There is currently no defined, industry-accepted method for characterizing
    the performance of electrical circuit probes. Each vendor has its own proprietary
    methods for characterization, leaving probe customers and users without a valid
    means of comparing probe performance and/or understanding the circuit-loading
    effect of the probe. This standard provides methods for measuring parameters indicative
    of a probes or probe systems performance and provides guidance on the design and
    use of a test fixture for measuring probe performance. These methods provide an
    industry-accepted, unbiased means for characterizing probe performance. This standard
    considers high-impedance voltage probes that are used to measure the performance
    of electrical circuits. The probe systems may include waveform acquisition hardware
    and software and signal/waveform analysis software. The probe will include the
    mechanism by which the circuit is contacted. This method and standard will be
    applicable to all individual probes having one signal conductor and one ground
    conductor or two signal conductors, and having an input impedance at least five
    times greater than the impedance of the circuit under test
