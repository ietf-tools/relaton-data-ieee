abstract:
- content: Circuitry that may be added to an integrated circuit to provide access
    to on-chip Test Access Ports (TAPs) specified by IEEE Std 1149.1 is described
    in this standard. The circuitry uses IEEE Std 1149.1 as its foundation, providing
    complete backward compatibility, while aggressively adding features to support
    test and applications debug. It defines six classes of IEEE 1149.7 Test Access
    Ports (TAP.7s), T0 to T5, with each class providing incremental capability, building
    on that of the lower level classes. Class T0 provides the behavior specified by
    1149.1 from startup when there are multiple on-chip TAPs. Class T1 adds common
    debug functions and features to minimize power consumption. Class T2 adds operating
    modes that maximize scan performance. It also provides an optional hot-connection
    capability to prevent system corruption when a connection is made to a powered
    system. Class T3 supports operation in either a four-wire Series or Star Scan
    Topology. Class T4 provides for communication with either a two-pin or four-pin
    interface. The two-pin operation serializes IEEE 1149.1 transactions and provides
    for higher Test Clock rates. Class T5 adds the ability to perform data transfers
    concurrently with scan, supports utilization of functions other than scan, and
    provides control of TAP.7 pins to custom debug technologies in a manner that ensures
    current and future interoperability.
