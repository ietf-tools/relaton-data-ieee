abstract:
- content: This part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 defines communication methods and data
    formats for transducers (sensors and actuators) communicating with RFID tags.
    This part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 also defines Transducer Electronic Data Sheet
    (TEDS) formats based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 family of standards and protocols
    for accessing TEDS and transducer data. It adopts necessary interfaces and protocols
    to facilitate the use of technically differentiated, existing technology solutions.
    It doesnt specify transducer design or signal conditioning.There is currently
    no openly defined independent interface standard between transducers and RFID
    tags. Each vendor builds its own interface. Without such standard, transducer
    interfacing and integration to RFID tags and systems are time-consuming and all
    vendors duplicated efforts are economically unproductive. The purpose of this
    part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 is to provide interfaces and methods for interfacing
    transducers to RFID tags and reporting transducer data within the RFID infrastructure.
    It also provides means for device and equipment interoperability.
