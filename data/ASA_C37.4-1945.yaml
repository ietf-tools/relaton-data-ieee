abstract:
- content: This publication represents standard practices in the United States relating
    to alternating-current power circuit breakers. It contains data secured from many
    sources notably the established standards of the American Institute of Electrical
    Engineers and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. It also includes
    data prepared by the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies. This publication
    combines, in one reference work, information relating to the terms and conditions
    upon which the rating and behavior of alternating-current power circuit breakers
    are based. The publication is divided into six parts. The main part consists of
    a definite Standard, C37.4-1945, for alternating-current power circuit breakers,
    which covers definitions and ratings of apparatus coming within the scope of this
    work. The remainder consists of supplementary standards, one of which, C37.9-1945,
    covers the procedure for testing circuit breakers. The Schedule of Preferred Ratings
    for Indoor and Outdoor Circuit Breakers, C37.6-1945, is included.
