abstract:
- content: 'Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of the communication
    between personal basic electrocardiograph (ECG) devices and managers (e.g. cell
    phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner
    that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions
    of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and IEEE Std 11073-20601
    information models. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and
    behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks
    in favor of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication
    functionality for personal telehealth basic ECG (1 to 3-lead ECG) devices. Monitoring
    ECG devices are distinguished from diagnostic ECG equipment with respect to: including
    support for wearable ECG devices; limiting the number of leads supported by the
    equipment to three; not requiring the capability of annotating or analyzing the
    detected electrical activity to determine known cardiac phenomena. This standard
    is consistent with the base framework and allows multi-function implementations
    by following multiple device specializations (e.g., ECG and respiration rate).'
