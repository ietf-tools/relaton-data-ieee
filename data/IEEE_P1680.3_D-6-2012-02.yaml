abstract:
- content: This standard establishes a clear and consistent set of environmental performance
    criteria for the design of televisions, providing an opportunity for manufacturers
    to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of
    electronic products. This standard is also intended to provide a tool for government,
    institutional, corporate and consumer purchasers to identify products that demonstrate
    environmental leadership. This standard shall be updated and revised on a periodic
    basis to continue to set a higher performance standard for leadership products.
