abstract:
- content: This guide discusses operational parameters that may be observed by battery
    monitoring equipment used in stationary applications, and the relative value of
    such observations. Although this guide does not give a listing of commercially
    available systems, it does provide a means for establishing specifications for
    the desired parameters to be monitored.
