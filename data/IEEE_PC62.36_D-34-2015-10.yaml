abstract:
- content: This standard applies to surge protectors for application on multiconductor
    balanced or unbalanced data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages
    equal to or less than 1000 V rms, or 1200 V dc. These surge protectors are designed
    to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both.This standard describes the methods
    of testing and criteria for determining the end of life of electrical surge protectors
    used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits. The surge protectors
    covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear
    elements, packaged for the purpose of limiting voltage, current, or both. This
    standard describes the methods of testing and criteria (where appropriate) for
    the characteristics and ratings of surge protectors used in information and communications
    technology (ICT) circuits, and smart grid data circuits. This standard is not
    intended to cover packaged single gas tube, air gap, varistor, or avalanche junction
    surge protective components, which are covered by IEEE Std C62.31 [IEEE Standard
    Test Specifications for Gas-Tube Surge Protective Devices], IEEE Std C62.32 [IEEE
    Standard Test Specifications for Low-Voltage Air Gap Surge Protective Devices],
    IEEE Std C62.33 [IEEE Standard Test Specifications for Varistor Surge Protective
    Devices], and IEEE Std C62.35 [IEEE Standard Test Specifications for Avalanche
    Junction Semiconductor Surge Protective Devices], respectively. Specifically excluded
    from this standard are test methods for low-voltage power circuit applications.
    For protection of wire-line communication facilities under the specialized conditions
    found at power stations, consult IEEE Std 487 [IEEE Recommended Practice for the
    Protection of Wire-Line Communication Facilities Serving Electric Power Stations].
