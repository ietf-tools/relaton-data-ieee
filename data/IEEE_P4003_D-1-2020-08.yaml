abstract:
- content: In February 2019 a Project Authorization Request was approved by the Institute
    of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Association with the
    title “Standard for Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R)
    Data and Metadata Content”. A Working Group was assembled to develop this standard
    with the purpose of unifying and documenting GNSS-R calibration procedures and
    product level definitions. The Working Group (https://sagroups.ieee.org/4003/)
    includes members, collaborators, and contributors from academia, international
    space agencies, and private industry. In a face-to-face meeting held during the
    ARSI+KEO 2019 Conference, the need was recognized to develop a standard with a
    wide range of operations, providing procedure guidelines independent of any constraints
    imposed by current limitations on geophysical parameter retrieval algorithms.
    As such, this effort aims to establish the fundamentals of a potential network
    of satellites providing inter-comparable data to the scientific community
