abstract:
- content: Background information necessary for proper construction of aging mechanisms
    and selection of diagnostic procedures when designing tests for functional evaluation
    of insulation systems for electrical equipment is presented. Aging mechanisms
    of insulation systems and methods for ascertaining correlation of aging during
    testing and aging during actual service are described. Diagnostic techniques for
    use in functional tests are also listed. The intent is primarily to aid committees
    in standardizing tests within the scope of their responsibilities.
