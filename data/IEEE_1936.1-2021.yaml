abstract:
- content: A framework for support of drone applications is established in this standard.
    Typical drone application classes, application scenarios, and required application
    execution environments are specified. The general facility requirements of drone
    applications are listed, including flight platform, flight control system, ground
    control station, payload, control link and data link, takeoff and landing system,
    etc. The drone safety and management requirements include airworthiness, airspace
    and air traffic requirements, qualification of operators, qualification of personnel,
    insurance, confidentiality, and others. The general operation process is detailed.
    The operation results stipulate the operation record and operation report, including
    data classification, data collection and processing, data record and analysis,
    and data reference format.
