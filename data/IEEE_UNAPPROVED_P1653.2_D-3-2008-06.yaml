abstract:
- content: This standard covers design, manufacturing, and testing unique to the application
    of uncontrolled semiconductor power rectifiers for dc supplied transportation
    substation applications up to 1500 Volts dc nominal output. The standard is intended
    to address traction power substation rectifiers that are to be provided as part
    of a rectifier transformer unit, or provided separately. This standard includes
    application information and extensive definitions of related technical terms.
