abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to present a simplified method of calculating
    the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead lines when given the weather
    conditions. This standard includes a mathematical method, and indicates sources
    of the values to be used in the calculation. Because there is a great diversity
    of weather conditions and operating circumstances for which conductor temperatures
    must be known, each utility shall make its own assessment of the data that will
    best pertain to its area or a particular transmission line.
