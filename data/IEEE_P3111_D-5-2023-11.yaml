abstract:
- content: There are a large number of public infrastructure installations with a
    wide range of locations including high-voltage transmission lines, railway high-voltage
    lines, communication towers, road light poles, and similar structures. Unwanted
    intrusion of foreign matter into public infrastructure equipment is a frequent
    occurrence, for example, kites, advertising banners and sun-shade nets are often
    found during maintenance operations, especially in high-voltage transmission lines
    and railway high-voltage lines. Once exposed to an environment of rain, snow,
    or dew, invasive moistened foreign matter may lead to extremely dangerous situations
    of line tripping or triggering line interphase short circuits and causing blackouts
    or even falling onto and burning out damaged wires as well as possibly causing
    human and animal injuries. These situations pose a great threat to the reliability
    and security of the electrical power supply system.
