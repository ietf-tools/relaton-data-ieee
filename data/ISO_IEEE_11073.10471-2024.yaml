abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of communication between personal telehealth
    independent living activity hub devices and compute engines (e.g., cell phones,
    personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that
    enables plug-and-play interoperability is established in this standard. Appropriate
    portions of existing standards, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information
    models, application profile standards, and transport standards are leveraged.
    The use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments
    restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability are specified.
    A common core of communication functionality for personal telehealth independent
    living activity hubs is defined in this standard.
