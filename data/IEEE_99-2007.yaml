abstract:
- content: Revision of IEEE Std 99-1980. A general form is provided for the preparation
    of test procedures. Points to be considered by technical committees in the preparation
    of specific instructions for the thermal evaluation of insulation systems for
    electric equipment are suggested. The test procedures involve accelerated thermal
    aging of insulation systems and specify tests that the committees deem pertinent,
    based on conditions of use. The objective of the procedures is to provide for
    the functional evaluation, by test, of insulation systems for electric equipment.
