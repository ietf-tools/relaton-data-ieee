abstract:
- content: The effective application of relays for protection of power system electrical
    buses is addressed. Common bus arrangements and some special arrangements used
    in the United States are covered; not all bus protection systems or all possible
    bus arrangements are included. Factors that determine the need and type of bus
    protection, and basic principles of bus protection operation are discussed. Relay
    input sources are covered. Bus protection systems and common bus arrangements
    with relay input sources are described. Also discussed are current transformer
    locations, wiring and grounding, location of the bus on the system, bus construction,
    problems associated with switching and bypassing, auxiliary tripping relays, reclosing
    of breakers after a bus differential operation, testing of bus differential relaying,
    and bus backup protection.
