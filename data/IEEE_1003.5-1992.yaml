abstract:
- content: This standard is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications
    and user interfaces to open systems. It defines the Ada language bindings as package
    specifications and accompanying textual descriptions to the application program
    interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the source
    level through the binding between ISO 8652:1987 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990
    (IEEE Std 1003.1-1990) (POSIX). Terminology and general requirements, process
    primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input and output primitives,
    device- and class-specific functions, language-specific services for Ada, and
    system databases are covered. It also specifies behavior to support the binding
    that must be provided by the Ada compilation system. The emphasis in POSIX is
    on application programs, so the interfaces in this document are not sufficient
    to implement an Ada compilation system or a POSIX shell, nor is this standard
    meant to be sufficient for real-time applications.
