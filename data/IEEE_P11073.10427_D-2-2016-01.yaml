abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of power status communication between personal
    health devices and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal health
    appliances, and set top boxes) is established by this standard in a manner that
    enables plug-and play interoperability. Appropriate portions of existing standards
    are leveraged, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models, application
    profile standards, and transport standards. The use of specific term codes, formats,
    and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks
    in favor of interoperability are specified. A common core of communication functionality
    for monitoring the power status of personal health devices is defined in this
    standard.
