abstract:
  content: Information about grounding methods for generating station instrumentation
    and control (I&amp;C) equipment is provided. The identification of I&amp;C equipment
    methods to achieve both a suitable level of protection for personnel and equipment
    is included, as well as suitable noise immunity for signal ground references in
    generating stations. Both ideal theoretical methods and accepted practices in
    the electric utility industry are presented.
