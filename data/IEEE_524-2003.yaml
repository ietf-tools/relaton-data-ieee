abstract:
- content: 'Revision of IEEE Std 524-1992. SUMMARY: This guide provides general recommendations
    for the selection of methods, equipment, and tools that have been found to be
    practical for the stringing of overhead transmission line conductors and overhead
    groundwires. The guide also includes a comprehensive list of definitions for equipment
    and tools used in stringing and for stringing terms commonly employed. This guide
    does not address special conductors such as those used for river and canyon crossing.
    These conductors may be custom designed and often may require special considerations.'
