abstract:
- content: Various battery systems are discussed so that the user can make informed
    decisions on selection, installation design, installation, maintenance, and testing
    of stationary standby batteries used in uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems.
    This guide describes how the UPS battery charging and converter components can
    relate to the selection of the battery systems. Design requirements of the UPS
    components are beyond the scope of this document. Battery back-up systems for
    dc-output rectifiers are also beyond the scope of this document.
