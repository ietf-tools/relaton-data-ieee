abstract:
- content: 'The application of surge-protective devices for electric vehicle infrastructure
    with system voltages of 1000 V ac or 1500 V dc or less is encompassed in this
    guide. The document provides guidance for North American types of electric vehicle
    supply equipment (EVSE) and electric vehicles (EVs) that conform to the SAE J1772:
    2001. The guide includes applications such as power, data acquisition, and communications-related
    circuitry. The guide was developed for use by manufacturers, system designers,
    educators, and end users of electric vehicle supply equipment.'
