abstract:
- content: This guide covers general recommendations for the operation and maintenance
    of indoor, openly-ventilated, dry type distribution and power transformers with
    Class B insulation in ratings above 50 kva and above 600 volts, cooled by natural
    draft or forced draft.The successful operation of these transformers is dependent
    on proper installation, loading and maintenance as well as on proper design and
    manufacture. As with all electric apparatus, neglect of certain fundamental requirements
    may lead to serious trouble, if not to the loss of the equipment. For this reason,
    a wide distribution of information in regard to the care of dry type transformers
    is important, and these brief instructions are published for that purpose.In addition
    to the use of this guide, the manufacturer should be consulted for specific recommendations
    on special conditions. Also reference may be made to other publications, some
    of which are listed in the Appendix.
