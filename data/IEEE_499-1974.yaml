abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of these recommendations is to define and recommend specifications
    for electric drives and related electrical equipment for installation in the cement
    industry in order to promote: (1) safety to personnel and equipment (2) maximum
    reliability with minimum loss of production (3) reduced maintenance and increased
    life of equipment (4) clarification of needs and conditions to reduce special
    engineering and chance of error in specification (5) over-all economy.'
