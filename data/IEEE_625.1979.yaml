abstract:
- content: Superseded by 625-1990. Assists in the effective application of relays
    and other devices for the protection of shunt capacitors used in substations.
    It covers the protective considerations, along with recommended and alternate
    methods of protection for the most commonly used capacitor bank configurations.
    Capacitor bank design trade-offs are also discussed. This guide covers protection
    of filter tanks and very large EHV capacitor banks, but does not include a discussion
    of pole-mounted capacitor banks on distribution circuits or application of capacitors
    connected to rotating apparatus.
