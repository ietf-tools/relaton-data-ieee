abstract:
- content: The fundamentals of reliability analysis as it applies to the planning
    and design of industrial and commercial electric power distribution systems are
    presented. Included are basic concepts of reliability analysis by probability
    methods, fundamentals of power system reliability evaluation, economic evaluation
    of reliability, cost of power outage data, equipment reliability data, examples
    of reliability analysis. Emergency and standby power, electrical preventive maintenance,
    and evaluating and improving reliability of the existing plant are also addressed.
    The presentation is self-contained and should enable trade-off studies during
    the design of industrial and commercial power systems design, installation, and
    maintenance practices for electrical power and grounding (including both power-related
    and signal-related noise control) of sensitive electronic processing equipment
    used in commercial and industrial applications are presented.
