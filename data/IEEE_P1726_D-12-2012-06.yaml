abstract:
- content: 'This Guide provides general guidelines toward the preparations of a functional
    specification of transmission fixed series capacitor banks (FSC) using overvoltage
    protection based on three technologies: * metal oxide varistors * metal oxide
    varistors with a forced triggered bypass gaps, and thyristor protected series
    capacitors. * thyristor protected series capacitor.This Guide does not apply comprehensively
    to Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitors'
