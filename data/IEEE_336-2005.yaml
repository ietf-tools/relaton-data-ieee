abstract:
- content: This guide provides considerations for the pre-installation, installation,
    inspection, and testing of Class 1E power, instrumentation, and control equipment
    and systems of a nuclear facility. This guidance is applicable to initial construction,
    modification (backfit), and maintenance activities. This guide does not apply
    to periodic testing.
