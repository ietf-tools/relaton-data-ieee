abstract:
- content: Recommended practices for communication and interoperation of devices connected
    on an electric power substation Internet protocol (IP) network are provided. For
    the power engineer new to IP networking, this document provides an introduction
    to the concepts that need to be mastered as well as specific recommendations to
    follow when deploying the technologies. For equipment manufacturers and system
    integrators, it provides direction and requirements to facilitate interoperable
    electric utility information networks.
