abstract:
- content: Guidance for the designer/manufacturer/supplier in planning and implementing
    controls for the design and manufacture of lithium-ion and lithium-ion polymer
    rechargeable battery packs used for mobile computing devices is provided. The
    provisions of this standard work together, and they define approaches to design,
    test, and evaluate a cell, battery pack, and host device to mitigate battery system
    failure in end-user environments. Additionally, recommendations for end-user education
    and communication materials are provided in this standard. This approach suggests
    the interfaces between subsystems (e.g., cell, battery pack, host device) and
    end users are as important to system reliability as is robust subsystem design
    and testing. Therefore, subsystem interface design responsibilities for each subsystem
    designer/manufacturer/supplier are provided, as well as messaging and communication
    provisions for end-user awareness. The influence of the end user in system reliability
    is also recognized in this standard.
