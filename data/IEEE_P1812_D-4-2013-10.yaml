abstract:
- content: This trial-use guide contains instructions for conducting tests to determine
    the performance characteristics and machine parameters of permanent magnet (PM)
    machines. The tests described may be applied to motors and generators, as needed,
    and no attempt is made to partition this guide into clauses applying to motors
    and clauses applying to generators. It is not intended that this guide shall cover
    all possible tests, or tests of a research nature, but only those general methods
    that may be used to obtain the performance data and machine parameters. The schedule
    of factory and field tests, which may be required on new equipment, is normally
    specified by applicable standards or by contract specifications. This guide should
    not be interpreted as requiring any specific test in a given transaction or implying
    any guarantee as to specific performance indices or operating conditions. The
    term specified conditions for tests as used in this guide will be considered as
    rated conditions unless otherwise agreed upon. Rated conditions apply usually
    to the quantities listed on the machine nameplate.
