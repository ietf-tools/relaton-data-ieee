abstract:
- content: The protection of nuclear power plants following a design basis event is
    provided automatically by the protection systems as defined by IEEE Std 279-1971
    (ANSI N42.7-1972), Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating
    Stations, and by required specified manual actions. Following the automatic initiation
    of the protection systems, the operator has the responsibility of bringing the
    nuclear power plant to and maintaining it in a safe condition. The operator requires
    specific information to assist him in fulfilling this role. The scope of this
    document is limited to the design criteria for the monitoring display instrumentation
    required by the operator during the post accident period.
