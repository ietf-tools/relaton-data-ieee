abstract:
- content: This recommended practice establishes requirements for a three-conductor
    round-type oil-well cable used in supplying three-phase ac electric power to submersible
    pump motors. Cables meeting the requirements of the recommended practice shall
    be rated for voltages not exceeding 3 kV or 5 kV and for ambient temperatures
    not exceeding 257 F (125 C). Use of cable above rated temperature can cause premature
    deterioration of the insulation. Voltage ratings are nominal phase-to-phase ratings.
