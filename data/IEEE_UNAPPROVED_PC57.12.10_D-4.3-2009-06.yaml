abstract:
- content: 'This voluntary consensus standard sets forth the requirements for outdoor
    power transformer application. This standard is intended for use as a basis for
    performance, interchangeability, and safety of equipment covered, and to assist
    in the proper selection of such equipment. This is a product standard which covers
    certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics of 50 and 60 Hz,
    liquid immersed power and auto-transformers. Such power transformers may be remotely
    or integrally associated with either primary switchgear or substations, or both,
    for step-down or step-up purposes base rated as follows: 833 KVA and above single-phase,
    750 KVA and above three-Phase. This standard applies to all liquid-immersed power
    and auto transformers that do not belong to the following types of apparatus:
    Instrument Transformers, Step voltage and induction voltage regulators, Arc-Furnace
    Transformers, Rectifier Transformers, Specialty Transformers, Grounding Transformers,
    Mobile Transformers, Mine Transformers'
