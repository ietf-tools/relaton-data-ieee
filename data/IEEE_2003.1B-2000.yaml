abstract:
- content: This standard defines the test method specifications for IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993
    (based on the document corresponding to the merger of IEEE Std 1003.1-1990 and
    IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993). The test method specifications consist of assertions to
    be tested and related test procedures. As an amendment to IEEE Std 1003.1-1990,
    this standard is structured to amend those portions of IEEE Std 2003.1-1992 {4}
    (the test method specification for IEEE Std 1003.1-1990) that correspond to the
    amended parts of IEEE Std 1003.1-1990. This standard is aimed primarily at providers
    of test methods for IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 and at implementors of IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993.
