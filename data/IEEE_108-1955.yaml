abstract:
- content: The purpose of these specifications is to give a common basis of comparison
    among electronic voltmeters offered for generalpurpose applications. It is recommended
    that all manufacturers offering instruments for general applications supply the
    information outlined. For the purpose of these specifications, general-purpose
    voltmeters do not include instruments which are primarily intended for measurement
    of pulses or similar diseontinuous vaveforms, or instruments of the electrometer
    type which are designed to provide an extremely high input resistance (1010 ohms
    or more). It is recognized that a d d i t i o n a l information should be supplied
    with instruments in theseand other special groups which manufacturers should not
    be asked to supply when they are offering instruments for more genera1 applications.
