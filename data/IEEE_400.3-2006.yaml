abstract:
- content: This guide covers the diagnostic testing of new or service-aged installed
    shielded power cable systems, which include cable, joints, and terminations, using
    partial discharge (PD) detection, measurement, and location. Partial discharge
    testing, which is a useful indicator of insulation degradation, may be carried
    out on-line or off-line by means of an external voltage source. This guide does
    not include the testing of compressed gas insulated systems or continuous on-line
    monitoring at normal service voltage.
