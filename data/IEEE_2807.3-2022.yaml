abstract:
- content: Guidelines for knowledge graphs (KGs) in electric power fields are provided
    in this guide. Data and schema requirements, an electric power-oriented KG construction
    process, KG integration, performance evaluation, and application scenarios are
    also discussed. Institutions and enterprises that develop KGs in the electric
    power field follow the general implementation method outlined here. In addition,
    suppliers may be supported in providing compatible KGs under the unified power
    knowledge model and interface specifications. With this guide, electric power
    KGs can be simply and efficiently combined and integrated, forming a more complete
    and accurate knowledge service ecosystem in the power industry.
