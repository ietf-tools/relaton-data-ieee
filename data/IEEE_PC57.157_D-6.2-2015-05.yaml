abstract:
- content: This guide is intended for use in establishing a methodology to evaluate
    expected longterm performance of infrequently operated switch contacts used within
    insulating liquid transformers. These switch contacts are typically found in de-energized
    tapchangers, dual voltage switches, reversing switches, on-load tapchangers, and
    step voltage regulators, but the test might possibly be used to evaluate any contact
    that is used in insulating liquids with similar operating characteristics and
    within similar environments.
