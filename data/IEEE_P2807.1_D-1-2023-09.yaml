abstract:
- content: This standard defines technical requirements, performance metrics, evaluation
    criteria and test cases for knowledge graphs. The mandatory test cases include
    data input, metadata, data extraction, data fusion, data storage and retrieval,
    inference and analysis, and knowledge graph display. This standard can be applied
    in various organizations that plan, design, develop, implement, and apply knowledge
    and in organizations that develop support technologies, tools, and services to
    knowledge graphs.
