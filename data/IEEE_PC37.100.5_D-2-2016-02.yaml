abstract:
- content: The terms and definitions in the standard are intended to encompass the
    products within the scope of the C37 series of standards that include power switchgear
    for switching, interrupting, metering, protection, and regulating purposes as
    used primarily in connection with generation, transmission, distribution, and
    conversion of electric power. The definitions of terms and explanatory notes relating
    thereto contained in this standard are not intended to embrace all possible meanings
    of the terms. They are intended for the sole purpose of establishing only those
    meanings of terms used in switchgear standards. They do not purport to embrace
    other meanings that the terms may properly have when used in connection with other
    subjects. In some instances, terms and definitions that are not identical to those
    in this standard have been developed by other branches of industry. Where this
    situation exists, the definitions in this standard shall be used for power switchgear
    within the C37 series of standards. This is mostly a copy of the existing scope
    of the C37.100 standard, and also mimics some of the information in the existing
    PAR draft purpose
