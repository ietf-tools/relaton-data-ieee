abstract:
- content: Liver and gallbladder diseases affect more than one billion people around
    the world, but there is still a lack of successful experience and models in terms
    of data standardization, integration and sharing of liver and gallbladder diseases.
    In order to solve this problem, based on the research of China's "Hepatobiliary
    Disease Data Standard Dataset", combined with the traceable and non-tamperable
    core technical support of blockchain technology, the team proposed "Blockchain-Based
    Hepatobiliary Disease Data Extraction and Exchange Standards, which standardize
    the data collection, processing and exchange process of hepatobiliary disease
    data in the medical information system, aiming to bring a new data credible circulation
    innovation model for medical education, data sharing applications, and medical
    artificial intelligence product research and development of hepatobiliary disease
    big data.
