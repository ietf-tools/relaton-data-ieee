abstract:
- content: This standard sets forth the requirements for a calibration program to
    control and verify the accuracy of measuring and test equipment used to ensure
    that important parts of a nuclear facility are in conformance with prescribed
    technical requirements and that data provided by testing, inspection, or maintenance
    are valid. These requirements also cover modifications and those activities occuring
    during the operating phase that are comparable in nature and extent to related
    activities occuring during the initial construction of the facility.
