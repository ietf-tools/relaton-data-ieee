abstract:
- content: The application, design concepts, and implementation of computer-based
    control systems for hydroelectric power plant automation is addressed. Functional
    capabilities, performance requirements, interface requirements, hardware considerations,
    and operator training are discussed. Recommendations for system testing and acceptance
    are provided, and case studies of actual computer-based control applications are
    presented.
