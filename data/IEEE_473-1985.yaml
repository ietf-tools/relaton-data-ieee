abstract:
- content: Guidelines for the systematic, documented investigation of the amplitudes
    of RF electromagnetic fields found at one or more locations with respect to frequency,
    time, and position are provided. Periodic and random radiated electric and magnetic
    fields and conducted interference within the frequency range of 10 kHz to 10 GHz
    are considered. Although several aspects of radio-emission investigation are not
    addressed directly, including signal identification and discrimination; field
    emissions from regularly occurring, low-frequency, pulsed sources; and test enclosure
    fields, much information pertinent to these areas is provided.
