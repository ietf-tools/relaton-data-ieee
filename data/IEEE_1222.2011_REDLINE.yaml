abstract:
- content: The construction, mechanical, electrical, and optical performance, installation
    guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements, environmental considerations,
    and accessories for an all-dielectric, nonmetallic, self-supporting fiber optic
    (ADSS) cable are covered by this standard. The ADSS cable is designed to be located
    primarily on overhead utility facilities.
