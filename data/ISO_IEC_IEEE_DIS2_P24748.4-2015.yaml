abstract:
- content: The evolution of the harmonized set of ISO/IEC 15288-12207 related standards
    and technicalreports that are discussed in this International Standard provides
    detailed requirements and guidance on the application of system life cycle processes.
    This International Standard unifies technical and management requirements and
    guidance from several of these sources to specify the requirements for the content
    of a SEMP and to provide a common SEMP format. This International Standard also
    identifies the processes as defined in ISO/IEC 15288 to perform the necessary
    project planning activities to accomplish the project's technical effort and to
    develop the project's SEMP. Due to close alignment with the content of ISO/IEC
    24748, ISO/IEC 26702 is now Part 4 of the multi-part International Standard, ISO/IEC
    24748 (Systems and software engineering Life cycle management).
