abstract:
- content: The application of control and protection on a unified power flow controller
    (UPFC) using a modular multilevel converter (MMC) is specified in this guide,
    including application considerations, protection functions and performance, control
    strategies, and monitoring functions, as well as test and commissioning approaches.
    This guide can be used as the basis for the design, manufacture, testing, and
    commissioning of UPFC control and protection systems, benefiting both utilities
    and manufacturers.
