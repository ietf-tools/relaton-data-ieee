abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 60076 covers the requirements for phase-shifting transformers
    of all types. The scope excludes transformers with an unregulated phase shift.
    This document is limited to matters particular to phase-shifting transformers
    and does not include matters relating to general requirements for power transformers
    covered in existing standards in the IEC 60076 series or IEEE Std C57.12.00TM
    and IEEE Std C57.12.10TM.
