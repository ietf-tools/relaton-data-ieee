abstract:
- content: A set of standard methods and procedures for determining the shielding
    effectiveness of planar materials is provided. Such materials might comprise,
    but are not limited to, metals, coated plastics, fiber-filled polymers, textiles,
    and coated fabrics. The selection of the appropriate test method to determine
    the level of shielding provided in the intended application, to provide a basis
    for comparing the measuring results, is considered. Emphasis is placed on those
    measurement techniques that have been adopted through incorporation into standards,
    both commercial and military, or that have been used extensively in practice.
