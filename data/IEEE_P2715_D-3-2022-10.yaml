abstract:
- content: This document provides a set of standard methods and procedures for determining
    the shielding effectiveness of planar materials. Such materials might comprise,
    but are not limited to, metals, coated plastics, fiber-filled polymers, textiles,
    coated fabrics, etc. This document will guide the user in the selection of the
    appropriate test method in order to determine the level of shielding provided
    in the intended application, in order to provide a basis for comparing the measuring
    results. Emphasis is placed on those measurement techniques that have been adopted
    through incorporation into standards, both commercial and military, or that have
    been used extensively in practice.
