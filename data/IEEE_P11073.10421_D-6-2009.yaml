abstract:
- content: This standard addresses a need for an openly defined, independent standard
    for controlling information exchange to and from personal health devices (agents)
    and managers (e.g. cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances,
    set top boxes). Interoperability is key to growing the potential market for these
    devices and enabling people to be better informed participants in the management
    of their health.
