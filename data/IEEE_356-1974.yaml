abstract:
- content: 'Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Sep 15, 1995. This guide is the result
    of a survey of radio techniques employed for measuring the conductivity of the
    earth. Results are applicable to the design of communication channels that are
    influenced by the electrical characteristics of the earth. Emphasized are those
    techniques used at frequencies where the loss tangent is large. The techniques
    are classed broadly into those that make use of drill holes into the earth and
    those that do not. Also, a distinction is made between active and passive methods.
    Comments and critiques on the various techniques are included. Theoretical and
    practical details underlying some of the methods are given in the appendixes.'
