abstract:
- content: This standard contains methods for condition monitoring of organic and
    polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using tensile elongation
    techniques in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements.
    It includes the requirements for selection of samples, the measurement system
    and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results. Standards in the
    IEC/IEEE 62582-series are measurement standards, primarily for use in the management
    of ageing in initial qualification and after installation. IEC/IEEE 62582-1 General
    includes requirements for the application of the IEC/IEEE 62582 series and some
    elements which are common to all methods. Information on the role of condition
    monitoring in qualification of equipment important to safety is found in IEEE
    Std 323. This standard is intended for application to non-energised equipment.
