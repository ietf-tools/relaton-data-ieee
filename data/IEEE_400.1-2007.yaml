abstract:
- content: The recommended practices and procedures for direct voltage acceptance
    and maintenance testing of shielded, laminated dielectric insulated power cable
    systems rated 5 kV and above are presented in this guide. It applies to all types
    of laminated power cable systems such as paper insulated, lead covered, pipe-type,
    and pressurized cables that are intended for the transmission or distribution
    of electric power. The tabulated test levels assume that the cable systems have
    an effectively grounded neutral system or a grounded metallic shield.
