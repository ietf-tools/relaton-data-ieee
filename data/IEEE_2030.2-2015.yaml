abstract:
- content: This guide applies the smart grid interoperability reference model (SGIRM)
    process (IEEE Std 2030-2011) to energy storage by highlighting the information
    relevant to energy=storage system (ESS) interoperability with the energy power
    system (EPS). The process can be applied to ESS applications located on customer
    premises, at the distribution level, and on the transmission level (i.e., bulk
    storage). This guide provides useful industry-derived definitions for ESS characteristics,
    applications, and terminology that, in turn, simplify the task of defining system
    information and communications technology (ICT) requirements. As a result. these
    requirements can be communicated more clearly and consistently in project specifications.
    This guide also presents a methodology that can be used for most common ESS projects
    to describe the power system, communications, and information technology (IT)
    perspectives based on the IEEE 2030 definitions. From this framework, a seemingly
    complex system can be more clearly understood by all project stakeholders. Emerging
    cybersecurity requirements can also be incorporated into the framework as appropriate.
    Additionally, this guide provides the templates that can be used to develop requirements
    for an ESS project and goes through several real-world ESS project examples step
    by step.
