abstract:
- content: It is the purpose of this Recommended Practice to define acceptable methods
    of testing electrical insulation in flight electric equipment. Test procedures
    are recommended for inspection of equipment electrical insulation to determine
    its flight worthiness after service, repair, and/or periods of storage. This Recommended
    Practice is intended only as a guide to acceptable procedure. It is not intended
    to be used as a test specification for specific equipment. The values of test
    voltages and other test conditions for specific equipment are always determined
    by the procurement specification for that particular equipment.<<ETX>>
