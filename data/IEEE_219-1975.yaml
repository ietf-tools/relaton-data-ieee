abstract:
- content: These recommendations apply to loudspeakers and loudspeaker systems. The
    recommendations define terms associated with loudspeakers and their testing, recommend
    methods of testing on which there is general agreement, and indicate preferred
    methods of presenting information regarding their characteristics. They involve
    physical, steady-state measurements only. Methods of measurement are stated in
    such a manner as to constitute recommendations to competent technical personnel
    acquainted with current practices in electroacoustical measurements.
