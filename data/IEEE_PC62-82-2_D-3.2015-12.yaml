abstract:
- content: The calculation method for selection of phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase
    insulation withstand voltages for equipment is presented. This guide gives methods
    for insulation coordination of different air-insulated systems like transmission
    lines and substations. The methods of analysis are illustrated by practical examples.
