abstract:
- content: Guidelines for the definition of a reliability program at nuclear power
    generating stations are developed. Reliability programs during the operating phase
    of such stations are emphasized; however, the general approach applies to all
    phases of the nuclear power generating station life cycle (e.g., design, construction,
    start-up, operating, and decommissioning).
