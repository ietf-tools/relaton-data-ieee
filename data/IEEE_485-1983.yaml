abstract:
- content: Methods for defining the dc load in a generating station or a substation
    and for sizing a lead storage battery to supply that load are described. Some
    factors relating to cell selection are provided for consideration. This standard
    is based on commonly accepted methods used to define the load and to ensure adequate
    battery capacity and is applicable to all installations and battery sizes. The
    installations considered are designed for full-float operation with a battery
    charger serving to maintain the battery in a charged condition as well as to supply
    the normal dc load.
