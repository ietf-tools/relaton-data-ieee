abstract:
- content: 'This guide has been prepared to aid in the effective and uniform application
    of fuses, relays, and their associated switching equipment located at the point
    of interconnection between the utility and the consumer electrical systems. Descriptions
    of the various devices, definitions of terms, and references to other technical
    technical publications have been included to make the guide useful not only to
    relay engineers, but also to other technical people who may not be intimately
    familiar with the art of relaying, but who nevertheless have a responsibility
    for the installation and operation of such interconnections. It includes examples
    for relaying of typical installations, both with and without consumer generation,
    and with service from utility radial or loop feeders, either directly from the
    utility substation bus or from a transmission line. It is expected that the guide
    will be used by consulting engineers, utility relay and sales engineers, and by
    consumer engineering and maintenance personnel. The scope of this guide does not
    include the subject of lightning protection for electrical systems as provided
    by shielding or lightning arrester devices. Lightning is, of course, often the
    cause of short circuits on power systems, but only the clearing of these short
    circuits through the use of protective devices is within the scope of this guide.
    Reference material pertaining to lightning protection may be found in (1) IEEE
    Std 28-1972, Surge Arresters for AC Power Circuits (ANSI C62.1-1971) (2) ANSI
    C62.2-1969, Guide for Application of Valve-Type Arresters for AC Systems. This
    guide does not establish standards or recommendations with regard to personnel
    safety at the interconnection area with respect to ground-voltage-rise, transferred-potential,
    step-potential, and touch-potential considerations for faults on the utility system
    or on the consumer''s system. Reference material pertaining to grounding and safety
    may be found in the following: (1) IEEE Std 80-1961, Guide for Safety in AC Substation
    Grounding (2) ANSI C2.2-1960, NBS H81-1961, Safety Rules for the Installation
    and Maintenance of Electric Supply and Communication Lines (3) ANSI C1-1971, NFPA
    70-1971, National Electrical Code.'
