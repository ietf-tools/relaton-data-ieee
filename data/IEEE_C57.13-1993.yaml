abstract:
- content: Electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are covered, taking
    into consideration certain safety features, for current and inductively coupled
    voltage transformers of types generally used in the measuremtn of electricity
    and the control of equipment assoicated with the generation, transmission, and
    distribution of alternating current. The aim is to provide a basis for performance,
    interchangeability, and safety of equipment covered and to assist in the proper
    selection of such equipment. Accuracy classes for metering service are provided.
    The test code covers measurment and calculation of radio and phase angle, demagnetization,
    impedance and excitation measurements, polarity determination, resistance measurements,
    short-time characteristics, temperature rise tests, dielectric tests, and measurment
    of open-circuit voltage of current transformers.
