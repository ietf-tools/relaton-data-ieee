abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.13-2008. Electrical, dimensional, and mechanical
    characteristics are covered, taking into consideration certain safety features,
    for current and inductively coupled voltage transformers of types generally used
    in the measurement of electricity and the control of equipment associated with
    the generation, transmission, and distribution of alternating current. The aim
    is to provide a basis for performance, interchangeability, and safety of equipment
    covered, and to assist in the proper selection of such equipment. Accuracy classes
    for metering service are provided. The test code covers measurement and calculation
    of ratio and phase angle, demagnetization, impedance and excitation measurements,
    polarity determination, resistance measurements, short-time characteristics, temperature-rise
    tests, dielectric tests, and measurement of open-circuit voltage of current transformers.
