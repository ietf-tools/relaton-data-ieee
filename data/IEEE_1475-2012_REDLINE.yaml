abstract:
- content: The interfaces between and among functional systems on rail rapid transit
    vehicles are prescribed. The systems themselves are treated as "black boxes;"
    requirements for the input signals and the output response are given. For each
    category of interface, three types are listed in increasing technical sophistication.
