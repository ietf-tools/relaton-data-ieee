abstract:
  content: Adoption of IEEE Std 11073-10407-2008. Within the context of the ISO/IEEE
    11073 family of standards for device communication, this standard establishes
    a normative definition of communication between personal telehealth blood pressure
    monitor devices and compute engines(e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal
    health appliances, and set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability.
    It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073
    terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport
    standards. It specifies the use ofspecific term codes, formats, and behaviors
    in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor
    of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication functionality
    for personal telehealth blood pressure monitors
