abstract:
- content: The practices described in this guide apply to all instrument transformers,
    including capacitive voltage transformers (VTs) and linear couplers, irrespective
    of primary voltage or whether the primary windings are connected to, or are in,
    power circuits or are connected in the secondary circuits of other transformers
    as auxiliary current transformers (CTs) or VTs. This guide does not discuss the
    grounding of some applications. For example, grounding of gas insulated substations
    and metal clad switchgear is not discussed in this guide; the reader will find
    these topics addressed in IEEE Std 242. The grounding of circuits of core-balance
    CTs is also not discussed in this guide. The reader can also find this information
    in IEEE Std 242. Another issue that is not discussed in this guide is the practice
    of using separate safety and control grounds. For discussion on this topic, the
    reader is directed to IEEE Std 665.
