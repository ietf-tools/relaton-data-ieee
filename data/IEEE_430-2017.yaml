abstract:
- content: Uniform procedures for the measurement of radio noise generated by corona
    from overhead power lines and substations are established in this standard. Measurement
    procedures in this standard are also valid for other power-line noise sources
    such as gaps and harmonics; however, most of the precautionary information, analysis,
    and data plotting techniques were written and developed primarily for corona discharges.
    The procedures are not valid for measuring transient radio noise sources that
    occur during breaker or disconnect switching operations. The procedures apply
    in the frequency range of 0.010 MHz to 1000 MHz; however, the emphasis is on the
    standard amplitude-modulation broadcasting (0.535 MHz to 1.605 MHz) and television
    broadcasting (54 MHz to 72 MHz, 76 MHz to 88 MHz, 174 MHz to 216 MHz, and 470
    MHz to 698 MHz) bands. This standard is applicable to both ac and dc transmission
    lines and substations.
