abstract:
- content: This standard covers enclosed low-voltage ac power circuit breakers of
    the stationary or drawout type of two-, three-, or four-pole construction, with
    one or more rated maximum voltages of 635 V (600 V for units incorporating fuses),
    508 V, and 254 V for application on systems having nominal voltages of 600 V,
    480 V, and 240 V; unfused or fused circuit breakers; manually or power operated;
    and with or without electromechanical or electronic trip devices. It deals with
    service conditions, ratings, functional components, temperature limitations and
    classifications of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage
    requirements, test procedures, and application
