abstract:
- content: Electric, power systems, having outgrown simplicity a long time ago, continue
    to require more and better protection as the demand for power increases and the
    need for reliability becomes greater. Protective relaying has met this challenge
    by providing more sensitive, higher speed relay systems that are inherently reliable.
    Among the more significant protective developments that furthered the economic
    design of power systems are pilot, relaying schemes and direct, transfer tripping
    over telephone channels. In recent years a growing need developed for more versatile
    wire-pilot relay systems and more secure means for direct transfer tripping. These
    factors, in addition to technological changes in telephone communication plants
    affecting availability of metallic, telephone circuits, led to the consideration
    of audio-tone signals over telephone channels for these functions. Since audio
    tones had already been employed extensively for less demanding applications&#8212;telemetering,
    telegraphy, dial signaling, etc.&#8212;it appeared logical that audio tones could
    also be employed successfully for remote tripping of circuit breakers and wire-pilot
    relaying.
