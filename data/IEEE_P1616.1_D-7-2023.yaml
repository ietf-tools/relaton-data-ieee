abstract:
- content: This standardization defines the goals and metrics of a Data Storage System
    for Automated Driving (DSSAD). It identifies functions and common technical requirements
    for data storage requirements. It defines data elements relevant to Automated
    Driving System (ADS) Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5. It defines the usage of data
    amongst diverse end users. The standard compiles a compendium of data elements
    used in vehicles of categories M1 and N1 regarding their EDR and DSSAD for partial
    and fully automated vehicles. The standard also has an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD)
    port lockout / Near Field Communication (NFC) protocol for protection against
    data manipulation via the vehicle diagnostic port. This standard is made available
    without prejudice [[of]] to national and regional laws related to data privacy,
    protection, and personal data processing. Users are responsible for compliance
    with all such laws and regulations. This standard may be frequently updated to
    include relevant data definitions and data elements towards the development of
    automated vehicles. The overall goal is to create a data collection standard for
    automated driving that includes functional requirements for automated vehicle
    gateways and security guidelines for cloud-based automotive data recorder requirements.
