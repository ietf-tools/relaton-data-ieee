abstract:
  content: This test procedure is intended as a guide for impulse testing of insulated
    conductors. It is intended only for use as a design or development test, and not
    as a routine production or specification test. Special needs may require deviations
    from this test procedure. A uniform procedure, however, is desirable in most cases.
    This test procedure applies only to impulse tests on insulated conductors. This
    test procedure is not intended to replace any existing or future standards covering
    impulse generators, impulse testing or voltage measurements. It is intended to
    supplement such standards by indicating specific procedures for a specific type
    of system component.
