abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 993-1990, IEEE Trial-Use Standard for Test Equipment Description
    Language (TEDL), defines a language useful for describing automatic test equipment
    (ATE) instrumentation and configurations, as well as interface test adapters (ITA).
    Principally intended for testing environments using the ATLAS test language, TEDL
    can also be used to describe instrumentation in non-ATLAS environments.
