abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 716-1989 defines IEEE Common ATLAS (C/ATLAS), a high-order language
    for testing on Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). C/ATLAS is a widely acceptable
    programming language. Its single and unique construct expresses each language
    facility selected, to support structured programming equipment. The C/ATLAS language
    is designed to describe tests for implementation on ATE in terms that are independent
    of any specific test systems. C/ATLAS defines an operational standard, which is
    based on the language defined by ANSI/IEEE Std 416-1984, Standard ATLAS Test Language.
    Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems (ATLAS) is a test-oriented language
    for expressing test specifications and test procedures. IEEE Std 716-1989 describes
    the language used for writing Units Under Test (UUT) programs, so that these programs
    can operate on various makes and models of ATE, IEEE Std 716-1989 includes the
    required portion that forms the common basis of all ATLAS subsets, and the optional
    elements, such as nouns, noun modifiers, and units.<<ETX>>
