- content: Design considerations and procedures for storage, location, mounting, ventilation,
    assembly, and maintenance of lead-acid storage batteries for photovoltaic power
    systems are provided in this standard. Safety precautions and instrumentation
    considerations are also included. Even though general recommended practices are
    covered, battery manufacturers may provide specific instructions for battery installation
    and maintenance.
