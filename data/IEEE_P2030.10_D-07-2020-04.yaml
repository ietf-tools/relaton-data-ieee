abstract:
- content: This standard covers the design and operation of a dc microgrid for rural
    or remote applications based on extra low voltage dc to reduce cost and simplify
    stability. Such microgrids are typically operated without connecting to a nation's
    electric power system and are referred to as stand-alone microgrids.
