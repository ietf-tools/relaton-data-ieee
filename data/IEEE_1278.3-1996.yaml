abstract:
- content: Guidelines are established for exercise management and feedback in Distributed
    Interactive Simulation (DIS) exercises. Guidance is provided to sponsors, providers,
    and supporters of DIS compliant systems and exercises as well as to developers
    of DIS exercise management and feedback stations. The activities of the organizations
    involved in a DIS exercise and the top-level processes used to accomplish those
    activities are addressed. The functional requirements of the exercise management
    and feedback process are also addressed. This standard is one of a series of standards
    developed for DIS to assure interoperability between dissimilar simulations for
    currently installed and future simulations developed by different organizations.
