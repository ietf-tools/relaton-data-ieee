abstract:
- content: This guide recommends safety measures that should be taken to help keep
    passive optical elements and optical fiber cables used in high power industrial
    laser systems from being affected by optical, opto-machines, and related effects
    are recommended in this guide. The guide is intended to be used by laser system
    manufacturers, installers and service providers, and endusers. The purpose is
    to help reduce the possibility of injury by reducing radiation risks and to improve
    control of the laser radiation hazards through protective features of laser transmission
    systems.
