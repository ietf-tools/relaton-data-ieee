abstract:
- content: Protective devices, such as relays and fuses, have well-defined operating
    characteristics that relate fault magnitude to operating time. It is desirable
    that these characteristic curves be coordinated with comparable curves applicable
    to dry-type transformers that relate duration and fault magnitude to withstand
    capability. This guide sets forth recommendations believed essential for the application
    of overcurrent protective devices applied to limit the exposure time of dry-type
    transformers to short-circuit currents. This guide is not intended to imply overload
    capability.<<ETX>>
