abstract:
- content: This Standard applies to all overhead, pad mounted, dry vault and submersible
    single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers and fault
    interrupters for rated maximum voltages above 1000 V and up to 38 kV. In order
    to simplify this standard where possible, the term recloser/FI (reclosers/FIs)
    has been substituted for automatic circuit recloser or fault interrupter or both.
    NOTE--When reclosers are applied in substation, special considerations may apply.
