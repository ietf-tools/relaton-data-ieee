abstract:
- content: This standard applies to semiconductor radiation detectors that are used
    for the detection and high-resolution spectroscopy of charged particles. The measurement
    techniques described were selected to be readily available to all manufacturers
    and users of charged-particle detectors. The object of this standard is to establish
    standard test procedures for semiconductor charged-particle detectors. These detectors
    are in widespread use for the detection and high-resolution spectroscopy of charged
    particles. It is desirable to maintain standard test procedures so that measurements
    may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users.<<ETX>>
