abstract:
- content: In this paper, you will find a straightforward overview of the value and
    necessity of utilizing AI ethics for businesses, recommendations for creating
    a sustainable culture of AI ethics, the skills required to do this, and how to
    hire and staff for such an effort. We have also included an AI Ethics Readiness
    Framework to help you determine how prepared you are to introduce and grow AI
    ethics in your business. This is the first paper in the Ethically Aligned Design
    for Business series created by The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous
    and Intelligent Systems (A/IS). More than a dozen industry experts have provided
    insights in the following pages based on their front-line experiences as AI ethics
    thought leaders and practitioners in their organizations. By relating the recommendations
    within Ethically Aligned Design to their industry efforts, our committee members
    provide, for inspiration and mutual learning, pragmatic applications of AI ethics
    inspired by IEEE’s global community of academics, data scientists, engineers,
    and tech entrepreneurs. For more information on this and similar topics visit
