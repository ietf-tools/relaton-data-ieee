abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a standardized body of theory, techniques,
    and procedures for measuring the spectral characteristics of 8-VSB transmitters
    used for terrestrial transmission of digital television (DTV) in the frequency
    range near their assigned channels. Essential characteristics are specified and
    measurement procedures are given that ensure that all parties will obtain comparable
    results.
