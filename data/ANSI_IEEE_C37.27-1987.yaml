abstract:
- content: Low-voltage power circuit breakers of the 600 V insulation class with separately
    mounted current-limiting fuses, for use on ac circuits with available short-circuit
    current of 200 000 A (rms symmetrical) or less, are covered. Guidance is provided
    respecting coordination of circuit breaker and fuse, location of fuses, open fuse
    trip devices, addition of fuses to existing installations, protection of connected
    equipment, and tested combinations of circuit breakers and fuses.
