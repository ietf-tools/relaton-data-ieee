abstract:
- content: A set of application layer messaging services are provided in this standard
    that are applicable for the enterprise and End Device ends of an Advanced Metering
    Infrastructure (AMI). The application services include those useful for managing
    the AMI network assets defined by this standard. These messages may be transported
    over a wide range of underlying network transports such as TCP/IP, UDP, IEEE 802.11,
    IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.16, PLC, and SMS over GSM, over a wide range of physical
    media. Additionally, interfaces are defined for a Communication Module and a Local
    Port (e.g., an IEEE 1701 optical port).The described protocol is tailored for,
    but not limited to, the transport of IEEE 1377 Table data.Also, a means by which
    information can be sent in a secure manner using AES128 and the EAX' mode is provided
    in this standard. This standard was developed jointly with ANSI (published as
    ANSI C12.22) and Measurement Canada (published as MC12.22).
