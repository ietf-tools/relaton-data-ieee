abstract:
- content: The reference model that provides a common interpretation basis by which
    tools can express and communicate the observable features of system/software behavior
    to users and to other tools is presented in this standard. This standard specifies
    a conceptual metamodel for understanding and describing the causal behavior for
    a system. The purpose of this conceptual metamodel is to express causal behavior
    and compositions of causal behavior in a model that integrates all observable
    operational features of a system into one behavior specification. This conceptual
    metamodel is useful for analyzing systems, for constructing particular system
    behavior models, and for using those models in the specification, design, and
    evaluation of engineered systems. It provides the necessary semantic elements
    for describing general hardware/software systems, including hardware-only, software-only,
    or mixed system components, and it allows these different types of components
    to be treated in a consistent manner, providing a basis for representing a wide
    variety of systems.
