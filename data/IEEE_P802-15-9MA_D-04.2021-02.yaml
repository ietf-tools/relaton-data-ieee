abstract:
  content: This standard defines a message exchange framework based on information
    elements as a transport method for key management protocol (KMP) datagrams and
    guidelines for the use of some existing KMPs with IEEE Std 802.15.4&#8482;. A
    new KMP is not created in this standard. In support of KMP transmission and reception,
    a generic multiplexed data service layer that can be used to transmit large packets
    from the upper KMP to another peer and that provides for protocol discrimination
    is also provided in this standard. The multiplexed data service provides a fragmentation
    and multiplexing layer for those packets so they can be delivered over smaller
    MAC layer frames and multiplexed on the recipient end to the right processing
    service. The multiplexing provides for EtherType protocol discrimination.
