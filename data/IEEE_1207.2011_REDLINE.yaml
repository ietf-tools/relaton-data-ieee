abstract:
- content: This guide is intended to complement IEEE Std 125&#x2122;, providing application
    details and addressing the impact of plant and system features on hydroelectric
    unit governing performance. It provides guidance for the design and application
    of hydroelectric turbine governing systems. There is a heightened awareness within
    the electric utility industry of the importance in the effective application of
    governing systems for dynamic stability. The need exists to provide guidance in
    the effective governing system application for a better understanding among users.
