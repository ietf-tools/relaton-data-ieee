abstract:
- content: System on Chip (SoC) test requires reuse of test data and test structures
    developed for individual cores (designs) when integrated into larger integrated
    circuits. This activity defines language constructs sufficient to represent the
    context of a memory-core and of the integration of that memory-core into an SoC,
    to facilitate development and reuse of test and repair mechanisms for memories.
    This activity also defines constructs that represent the test structures internal
    to the memory-core for reuse in the creation of the tests for the logic outside
    the memory-core. Semantic rules are defined for the language to facilitate interoperability
    between different entities (the memory-core provider, the system integrator, and
    the automation tool developer) involved in the creation of an SoC. The capabilities
    are an extension of IEEE 1450.6-2005. As a result of this extension, CTL's limitations
    of handling memories are addressed.
