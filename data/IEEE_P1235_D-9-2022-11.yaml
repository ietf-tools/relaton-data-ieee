abstract:
- content: Recommendations for colored stripes and raised ridges as identification
    markings on non-conducting and semiconducting underground power cable jackets
    are provided in this guide. Typically, power cables are identified by red stripes;
    however, other colors may be permitted. The guide also applies to the duct containing
    jacketed or unjacketed underground power cables. The colored stripe recommendations
    include the number of stripes, color, width, thickness, color retention characteristics,
    physical properties, storage criteria, and test methods. The raised ridge recommendations
    include physical properties, width, height, and circumferential spacing. It is
    the intent of this guide to provide a minimum level of physical, chemical, and
    color stability of colored stripes used to identify underground power cable jackets
    and ducts.
