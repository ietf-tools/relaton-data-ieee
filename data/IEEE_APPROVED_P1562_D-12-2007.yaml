abstract:
- content: This guide (in conjunction with IEEE Std. 1013<SUP>TM</SUP>) is a recommended
    method for properly sizing the PV array and battery for stand-alone PV systems
    where PV is the only charging source. Special attention needs to be made to load
    calculations and determination of solar radiation in the sizing of the system.
    Additionally, the critical nature of the load needs to be considered in deciding
    an acceptable annual availability.
