abstract:
- content: The application of Damped ac (DAC) for field testing of power cables is
    described. DAC voltage withstand testing and diagnostic tests and measurements
    that are performed in combination with DAC voltage application in the field on
    shielded power cable systems are discussed. Whenever possible, cable systems are
    treated in a similar manner to individual cables. Tables and figures are included
    to show the effectiveness of the DAC ac voltage test, the diagnostic evaluation
    and the user experiences in the past years for field testing of different medium
    and (extra) high voltage cable system.
