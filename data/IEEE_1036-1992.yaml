abstract:
- content: Guidelines for the application protection, and ratings of equipment for
    the safe and reliable utilization of shunt power capacitors are provided. This
    guide applies to the use of 50 and 60 Hz shunt power capacitors rated 2400 Vac
    and above, and assemblies of capacitors. Applications that range from simple unit
    utilization to complex bank situations are covered.
