abstract:
- content: Defined in this standard is an ontology that allows for the representation
    of, reasoning about, and communication of task knowledge in the learning, robotics,
    and automation domain. This ontology includes a list of essential terms and their
    definitions, attributes, types, structures, properties, constraints, and relationships.
    In addition, addresses how hierarchical planners and designers represent task
    knowledge allowing them to better communicate among levels of the ontology hierarchy.
