abstract:
- content: This standard defines an ontology 1 that allows for the representation
    of, reasoning about, and communication of Task task knowledge in the learning,
    robotics, and automation domain. This ontology includes a list of essential terms
    and their definitions, attributes, types, structures, properties, constraints,
    and relationships. In addition, it will address how hierarchical planners and
    designers represent task knowledge allowing them to better communicate among levels
    of the ontology hierarchy.
