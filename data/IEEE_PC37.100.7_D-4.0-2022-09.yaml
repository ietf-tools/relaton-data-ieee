abstract:
- content: Existing standards and performance criteria for switchgear rated above
    1000 V are reviewed in this guide. Each aspect of performance is discussed within
    the context of Sulfur Hexafluoride alternatives, how their behavior might differ
    from existing technologies and how this behavior can lead to changes in the qualification
    process. Relevant analytical, numerical and test methods are discussed which contribute
    to the process of performance evaluation and future evolution of the standards.
