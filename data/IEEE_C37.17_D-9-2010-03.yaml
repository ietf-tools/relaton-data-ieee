abstract:
- content: 'This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective
    functions of: 1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices 2) direct-acting
    overcurrent electronic trip systems 3) reverse-current trip systems 4) undervoltage
    trip devices, that are integral with low-voltage ac (635V and below) and general
    purpose low-voltage dc (600V and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE
    Std C37.13, IEEE Std C37.14, IEEE Std C37.16 and IEEE Std C37.27. Additional information,
    communication and/or additional internal or external protective functions or devices
    are not covered by this standard. This standard should not be interpreted to restrict
    the inclusion of such functionality in the device.'
