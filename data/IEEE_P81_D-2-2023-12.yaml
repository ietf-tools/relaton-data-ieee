abstract:
- content: Practical test methods and techniques 1 are presented for measuring the
    electrical characteristics of grounding systems. Topics addressed include safety
    considerations, measuring earth resistivity, measuring the power system frequency
    resistance or impedance of the ground system to remote earth, measuring the transient
    or surge impedance of the ground system to remote earth, measuring touch and step
    voltages, verifying the integrity of the grounding system, reviewing common methods
    for performing ground testing, reviewing instrumentation characteristics and limitations,
    and reviewing various factors that can distort test measurements.
