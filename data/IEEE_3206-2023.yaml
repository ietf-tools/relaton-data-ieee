abstract:
- content: The principles and methods for the classification of blockchain-based digital
    assets are proposed. This standard follows the principles of scientificity, systematicness,
    and scalability, and proposes an attribute-based classification method for blockchain
    digital assets, whose classification attributes include technical attributes,
    economic attributes and legal attributes.
