abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 was developed to assist users of ISO/IEC 15288:2008
    (IEEE Std 15288-2008) or ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207 2008) to acquire or
    supply software user documentation as part of the software life cycle processes.
    It defines the documentation process from the acquirer''s standpoint and the supplier''s
    standpoint. ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 covers the requirements for information items
    used in the acquisition of user documentation products: the Acquisition Plan,
    Document Specification, Statement of Work, Request for Proposals, and the proposal.
    It provides an overview of the software user documentation and information management
    processes which may require acquisition and supply of software user documentation
    products and services. It addresses the preparation of requirements for software
    user documentation. These requirements are central to the user documentation specification
    and Statement of Work. It includes requirements for primary document outputs of
    the acquisition and supply process: the Request for Proposal and the Proposal
    for user documentation products and services. It also discusses the use of a Documentation
    Management Plan and a Document Plan as they arise in the acquisition and supply
    processes. ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2011 is independent of the software tools that may
    be used to produce documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and
    on-screen documentation. Much of its guidance is applicable to user documentation
    for systems including hardware as well as software.'
