abstract:
- content: The metric mechanical coordination of microcomputer components, including
    the cabinet, rack, subracks, printed boards, and common connector-dependent dimensions
    for connector pitches of 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 mm is addressed. This generic
    standard may be applied in all fields of electronics where equipment and installations
    are required to conform to a metric modular order. This choice of coordination
    dimensions for the mechanical structure for heights, widths, and depths lies within
    a homogeneous, metric, modular, three-dimensional grid as specified in IEC 917.
    The intent is to provide a single metric equipment practice for worldwide use.<<ETX>>
