abstract:
- content: This standard extends IEEE Std 1450-1999 (STIL) to 39 provide an interface
    between test generation tools and test equipment with regard to the specification
    of the flow of execution of test program components. It defines structures such
    that test flows, sub-flows, and binning may be described in a manner that facilitates
    automated generation, modification, and/or manual maintenance, and although not
    yet a complete run-time test language, execution on automated test equipment (ATE).
    It defines an interface between tester configurations (described by IEEE Std 1450-1999
    and IEEE 1450.2-2002) and test program components. It defines a hierarchy of flows,
    sub-flows, and test components. It defines structures for defining flow related
    variables and processing expressions involving those variables. It provides structures
    that support automatic test program generation (ATPRG) and translation, and running
    it natively as an ATE programming language. As an adjunct, IEEE Std 1450.3-2007,
    may be used by ATPRG for tester rules checking.
