abstract:
- content: This document specifies a method for evaluating the fairness of machine
    learning. Multiple causes contribute to the unfairness of machine learning. In
    this document, these causes of machine learning unfairness are categorized. The
    widely recognized and used definitions of machine learning fairness are presented.
    This document also specifies various metrics corresponding to the definitions,
    and how to calculate the metrics. Test cases in this document give detailed conditions
    and procedures to set up the tests for evaluating machine learning fairness.
