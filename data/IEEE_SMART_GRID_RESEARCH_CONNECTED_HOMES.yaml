- content: 'In 2012, CABA conducted the Impact of Smart Grid on Connected Homes Landmark
    Research study with the objective of greatly improving the understanding of residential
    Smart Grid development and deployment in terms of: identifying market demand and
    growth areas for new products; comparing competing product strategies and communication
    of competitors; determining product preferences for end-users; developing messaging
    that resonates with the target audience; defining critical success factors to
    expand product offerings to end-user markets; and establishing a market approach
    and foundation for strategic decision-making efforts.'
