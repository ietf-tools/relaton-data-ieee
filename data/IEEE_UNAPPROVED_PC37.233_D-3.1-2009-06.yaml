abstract:
- content: This guide presents test approaches and procedures for the components and
    the overall protection and control system functions. Test of equipment in the
    system protection scheme, associated communications equipment, auxiliary power
    supplies, and the control of power apparatus are addressed. Much of the testing
    emphasizes a bottom-up approach, in which the basic behavior of scheme components
    are verified first, followed by testing of interconnected components in a function-oriented
    assembly.
