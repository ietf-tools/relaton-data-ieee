abstract:
- content: The performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria
    for a transmission line overhead ground wire (a.k.a. shield wire, static wire,
    earth wire, skywire) with optical fibers commonly known as optical ground wire
    (OPGW) are covered in this standard. Functional requirements such as electrical,
    mechanical, optical fiber, environmental, and packaging, and test requirements
    related to design, installation, in-service, and maintenance, including routine
    tests are also covered.
