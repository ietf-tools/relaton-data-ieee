abstract:
- content: The IEEE Std 488-1978, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable
    Instrumentation, deals with systems that use a byte-serial bit-parallel means
    to transfer digital data among a group of instruments and system components. The
    interface system described herein is optimized as an interdevice interface for
    system components in relatively close proximity able to communicate over a contiguous
    party-line bus system. This document contains seven sections as follows. Section
    1 contains the scope, the object, basic definitions, and summary description of
    the interface. Section 2 deals with functional concepts and specifications of
    the interface system described in this standard. One or more interface functions
    contained within a device are each able to process messages and change states
    to maintain an orderly flow of information among a set of interconnected devices.
    Section 3 deals with the electrical realization of the interface in order to transfer
    messages among a set of interconnected devices. Section 4 deals with the mechanical
    realization of the interface in order to implement the electrical aspects of the
    interface system.
