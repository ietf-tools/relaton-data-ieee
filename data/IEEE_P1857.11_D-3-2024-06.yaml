abstract:
- content: This standard defines a set of tools for efficient image coding, including
    tools for encoding, for decoding, and for encapsulation. Some of the tools are
    based on trained neural networks. These tools are designed to perform block partitioning,
    prediction, transform, quantization, entropy coding, filtering, etc., respectively.
