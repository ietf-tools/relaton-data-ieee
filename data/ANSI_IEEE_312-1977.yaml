abstract:
- content: This Standard contains many of the terms one might encounter in exposition
    on the design and use of communication switching systems. Definitions of these
    terms have either been submitted for the first edition or prepared for subsequent
    editions of the forthcoming IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms.
    Certain terms and definitions have been drawn from American National Standard
    Definitions of Electrical Terms, ANS 042.65-1907, and other existing documents;
    the remainder are modified or new (those that are modified with respect to the
    first edition of the IEEE Dictionary are marked with an asterisk).
