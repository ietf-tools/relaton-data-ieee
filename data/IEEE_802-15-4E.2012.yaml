abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 802.15.4-2011 is amended by this standard. The intention of this
    amendment is to enhance and add functionality to the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC to (a)
    better support the industrial markets and (b) permit compatibility with modifications
    being proposed within the Chinese WPAN.
