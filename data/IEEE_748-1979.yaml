abstract:
- content: 'This standard applies to frequency scanning spectrum analyzers. Instruments
    covered by this standard include: swept front end (superheterodyning in which
    the first local oscillator is swept); swept IF (superheterodyning in which other
    than the first local oscillator is swept); and video detector-tunable filter (analysis
    is accomplished by scanning the input filter across the signal in proportion to
    the CRT horizontal deflection with the detector output providing the vertical
    deflection). The purpose of this standard is to document the minimum specifications
    required by users or purchasers, or both, of spectrum analyzers. It will also
    provide a common means for comparison between instruments. In addition, uniformity
    of information from different manufacturers is realized.<<ETX>>'
