abstract:
- content: A vendor-independent generalized method for modeling spectrum consumption
    of any type of use of radio frequency spectrum and the attendant computations
    for arbitrating the compatibility among models are defined in this standard. The
    methods of modeling are chosen to support the development of tractable algorithms
    for determining the compatibility between models and for performing various spectrum
    management tasks that operate on a plurality of models. The modeling methods are
    exclusively focused on capturing spectrum use but are defined in a schema that
    can be joined with other schemata related to spectrum management
