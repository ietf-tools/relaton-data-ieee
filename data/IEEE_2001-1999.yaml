abstract:
- content: 'Superseded by 2001-2002 This standard defines recommended practices for
    Web page engineering. It addresses the needs of Webmasters and managers to effectively
    develop and manage World Wide Web projects (internally via an intranet or in relation
    to specific communities via an extranet). This standard discusses life cycle planning:
    identifying the audience, the client environment, objectives, and metrics, and
    continues with recommendations on server considerations, and specific Web page
    content. IEEE Std 2001-1999 defines conformance for both Web pages and tools that
    generate Web pages. This document is intended to reduce site-management costs,
    reduce legal risks, facilitate user satisfaction, and increase the productivity
    of Web applications for both maintainers and users.'
