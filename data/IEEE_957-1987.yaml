abstract:
- content: Superseded. Information on the equipment needed and the methods that can
    be used to clean contaminated electrical insulators are presented. The intent
    is to document the state of the art for cleaning insulators (excluding nuclear
    contaminants) of all types. Energized and de-energized systems are considered.
    The standard does not prescribe specific procedures, but rather reflects the experience
    of many individuals who have safely cleaned contaminated insulators.
