abstract:
- content: This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2002 as amended by IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002,
    IEEE Std 802.3af-2003, IEEE Std 802.3aj-2003, and IEEE Std 802.3ak-2004 combines
    a minimal set of extensions to the IEEE 802.3 Media Access Control (MAC) and MAC
    Control sublayers with a family of Physical (PHY) Layers. These Physical Layers
    include optical fiber and voice grade copper cable Physical Medium Dependent sublayers
    (PMDs) for point-to-point connections in subscriber access networks. This amendment
    also introduces the concept of Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs), in which
    a point to multi-point (P2MP) network topology is implemented with passive optical
    splitters, along with optical fiber PMDs that support this topology. In addition,
    a mechanism for network Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) is included
    to facilitate network operation and troubleshooting. To support these innovations,
    options for unidirectional transmission of frames are provided for 100BASE-X,
    1000BASE-X, 10GBASE-R, 10GBASE-W, and 10GBASE-X.
