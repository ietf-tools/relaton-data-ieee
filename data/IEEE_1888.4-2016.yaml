abstract:
- content: Protocols are provided for measurement and control networks for home and
    residential quarters so that they can achieve green, smarter functions. The interactive
    data format between devices and systems-as well as the standardized definitions
    of the sensor, actuator, and equipment, together with the data communication processes-are
    specified. The data format definition for configuration and management-oriented
    functions; the data format definition for deployment and control-oriented functions;
    and the method definition for conformance tests and interoperability tests are
    also included.
