abstract:
- content: Practical methods for making laboratory measurements of electroacoustic
    characteristics of analog and digital telephones, handsets and headsets. The methods
    may also be applicable to a wide variety of other communications equipment, including
    cordless, wireless and mobile communications devices. Measurement results may
    be used to evaluate these devices on a standardized basis. Application is in the
    frequency range from 100 to 8,500 Hz.
