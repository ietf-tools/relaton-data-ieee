abstract:
- content: This standard is applicable to bushings intended for use in high voltage
    circuit breakers and gas insulated switchgear. These bushings are intended for
    indoor and outdoor use, operating on alternating current with a rated voltage
    greater than 1000 V and a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz. These bushings are usually
    a part of an apparatus and tested according to the apparatus of which they form
    part.
