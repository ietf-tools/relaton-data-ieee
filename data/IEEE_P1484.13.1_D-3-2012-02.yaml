abstract:
- content: This Standard defines a conceptual model for interpreting externalized
    representations of digital aggregations of resources for learning, education,
    and training. The conceptual model defines a set of concepts and the relationships
    among them and is expressed as a formal ontology. Internal compositions and uses
    of digital resources are not specified nor are processing methods for resource
    aggregations.
