abstract:
- content: Load modeling plays an important role in power system modeling, and the
    load model is an indispensable component in power system simulation. To get accurate
    load models and formulate a unified document, this guide has been developed to
    provide comprehensive policies and procedures of load modeling and simulations.
    A review and comparison of the two most widely used methodologies for load modeling
    is presented in this document, that is, the measurement based and component-based
    approaches. A critical and updated overview of opportunities and challenges of
    load modeling with emerging networks and components is also provided. The guidelines
    for power system simulation with a variety of load models are proposed. A case
    study adhering to the proposed guidelines clearly indicates the need for a hybrid
    approach in the future that will combine the strengths of the measurement-based
    and component-based approaches with the data acquisition capabilities offered
    by modern measurement equipment.
