abstract:
- content: 'The following constitutes a revision of IEEE No.170 (53 IRE ll.Sl), "Standards
    on Modulation Systems: Definitions of Terms, 1953." It is not intended to cover
    the subject matter of Information Theory which is contained in IEEE No.171 (58
    IRE ll.Sl ), IRE Standards on Information Theory: Definitions of Terms, 1958.Nevertheless,
    a few borderline terms, such as Coding and Nyquist Rate, have been included in
    the list. This merely reflects the fact that the two Standards define terms in
    adjoining areas of subject matter.The definitions given in this Standard are intended
    to reflect the latest usage and also toimprove the clarity and precision. Terms
    such as Capture Effect have been newly added, whileterms no longer in use, such
    as Two-Source Frequency Keying, have been deleted.'
