abstract:
- content: Test equipment requirements and methods for testing the transmission characteristics
    of PCM telecommunications equipment, circuits, and systems are set forth. The
    requirements are intended for certification, installation, pre-service, out-of-service
    operational, and in-service operational tests of the PCM transmission facilities.
    The PCM equipment that may be tested includes primary multiplex equipment containing
    analog-digital conversion devices, digital multiplex equipment, digital links,
    and digital sections. This standard is limited to testing at the analog interfaces
    of the primary multiplex equipment and the digital interfaces at DS1, DS1C, DS2,
    and DS3 levels of the North American digital hierarchy. Synchronous multiplex
    equipment and equipment offering other than 64 kb/s coded voiceband channels are
    not covered in this standard, nor is signaling parameter measurement.
