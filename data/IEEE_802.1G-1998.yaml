abstract:
- content: 'Extensions to the behavior of ISO/IEC 10038 (IEEE 802.1D) media access
    control (MAC) bridges, including the aspects of operation of remote MAC bridges
    that are observable on the interconnected LANs, are specified. A protocol for
    (optional) use between remote MAC bridges, across the non-LAN communications equipment
    that interconnects them, to configure the remote bridges within the bridged LAN
    in accordance with the spanning tree algorithm of ISO/IEC 10038: 1993, is also
    provided. (ANSI/IEEE std 802.1G, 1998 Edition)'
