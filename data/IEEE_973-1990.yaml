abstract:
- content: 'This standard provides definitions of switching system performance in
    a telecommunications environment. It includes parameters in seven categories:
    (1) customer access; (2) network reliability; (3) billing; (4) transmission; (5)
    operating company; (6) customer signaling; (7) network service; The dimensions
    and critical aspects of each parameter are presented without numerical values.
    The definitions will facilitate a description of switching requirements for different
    networks and applications. Each application may be characterized by its own set
    of parameters and values. This standard provides definitions that will promote
    a consistent interpretation of performance by users, service providers, manufacturers,
    and designers.<<ETX>>'
