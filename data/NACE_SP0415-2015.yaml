abstract:
- content: This NACE/IEEE joint standard provides requirements to (1) help electric
    utilities identify structures that may be at a high risk for below-grade corrosion;
    (2) excavate and inspect the selected structures; (3) categorize the condition
    of structures based on corrosion degradation; (4) prioritize structures requiring
    additional inspection based on those findings; and (5) help identify next steps
    as required. The standard is limited to the inspection and assessment of steel
    transmission towers, poles, and substation structures, to include galvanized,
    self-weathering, and painted mild steel structures, as well as other similar structures.
