abstract:
  content: Diagnostic tests and measurements that are performed in the field on oil-immersed
    power transformers and regulators are described. Whenever possible, shunt reactors
    are treated in a similar manner to transformers. Tests are presented systematically
    in categories depending on the subsystem of the unit being examined. A diagnostic
    chart is included as an aid to identify the various subsystems. Additional information
    is provided regarding specialized test and measuring techniques.
