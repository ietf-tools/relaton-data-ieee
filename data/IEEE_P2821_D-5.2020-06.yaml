abstract:
  content: The UAV-based patrol inspection systems applied in operation and maintenance
    of transmission lines are demonstrated in this document. The system compositions,
    application scenarios, functions and performance, test methods, and guidance for
    field applications are provided. This guide applies to the UAV systems used for
    patrol inspection on AC and DC overhead transmission lines.
