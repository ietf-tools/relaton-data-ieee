abstract:
- content: 'General interface requirements and performance characteristics of payload
    devices in drones are presented. The drone payload interfaces are described in
    three categories: mechanical interface, electrical interface, and data interface.
    Mechanical interface is used to fix the payload to the drone. Electrical interface
    is an electromechanical device used to join electrical terminations. The electrical
    interface includes the power supply interface and the two-way communication interface.
    Data interface refers to the communication protocol. The requirements and performance
    characteristics of the drone payload interface are detailed from the aspect of
    protection from temperature extremes, humidity, water, dust, vibration/shock,
    mold, salt spray, etc. Typical drone payloads, interface requirements, and performance
    characteristics of specific payloads are illustrated.'
