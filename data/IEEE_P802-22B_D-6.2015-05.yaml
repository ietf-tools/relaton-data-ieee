abstract:
- content: This standard specifies alternate Physical Layer (PHY) and necessary Medium
    Access Control Layer (MAC) enhancements to IEEE std. 802.22-2011 for operation
    in Very High Frequency (VHF)/ Ultra High Frequency (UHF) TV broadcast bands between
    54 MHz and 862 MHz to support enhanced broadband services and monitoring applications.
    The standard supports aggregate data rates greater than the maximum data rate
    supported by the IEEE Std. 802.22-2011. This standard defines new classes of 802.22
    devices to address these applications and supports more than 512 devices in a
    network. This standard also specifies techniques to enhance communications among
    the devices and makes necessary amendments to the cognitive, security &amp; parameters
    and connection management clauses. This amendment supports mechanisms to enable
    coexistence with other 802 systems in the same band.
