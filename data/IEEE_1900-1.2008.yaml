abstract:
- content: This standard provides definitions and explanations of key concepts in
    the fields of spectrum management, cognitive radio, policy-defined radio, adaptive
    radio, software-defined radio, and related technologies. The document goes beyond
    simple, short definitions by providing amplifying text that explains these terms
    in the context of the technologies that use them. The document also describes
    how these technologies interrelate and create new capabilities while at the same
    time providing mechanisms supportive of new spectrum management paradigms such
    as dynamic spectrum access.

- content: Because of the complexity and interrelationship of some of the terms used
    in discussing advanced radio system technologies, additional tutorial material
    is provided in informative annexes and NOTES. It is the purpose of this additional
    tutorial material to amplify and clarify the briefer definitions. However, it
    is not the intent of this informative text to provide an exhaustive description
    of these technologies and new spectrum management concepts, but to provide high-level
    descriptive information to supplement the brief definitions. Clause 2 of the document
    provides definitions of advanced radio system terms, whereas Clause 3 defines
    the functional capabilities associated with these systems. Clause 4 defines some
    network technologies that support the distributed functionality of these systems.
    Spectrum management terms and definitions are found in Clause 5. Ancillary terms
    are found in Clause 6. The annexes are non-normative (not part of the standard)
    but are included to provide additional information on the advanced radio system
    and spectrum management concepts that are the focus of this standard.
