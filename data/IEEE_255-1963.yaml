abstract:
- content: 'This Standard provides a uniform system of letter symbols for electrical
    quantities and parameters as applied to semiconductor devices. It is divided into
    three Sections: (1) electrical quantities, dealing primarily with voltage, current,
    and time quantities; (2) electrical parameters, dealing with the relationship
    between specific electrical quantities; and (3) list of letter symbols in alphabetical
    order. The electrical parameters of Section 2 are ratios of the terminal electrical
    quantities, i.e. two-terminal-pair open-and-short-circuit ratios.<<ETX>>'
