abstract:
- content: Countries across the globe are implementing smart grids in order to achieve
    reductions in emissions, increased grid efficiency, increased usage of renewable
    energy sources, increased consumer control over their energy consumption, and
    other economic benefits. Despite the promised benefits of the Smart Grid, there
    are various concerns that need to be addressed such as security threats, privacy
    concerns, high infrastructure costs, and increased tariffs for effective implementation.
    A large number of possible threat scenarios and threat agents make it imperative
    for Smart Grid cyber security to be adequately addressed. This report details
    the cyber security vulnerabilities that exist in the Smart Grid value chain, the
    efforts undertaken by certain countries to mitigate these vulnerabilities, and
    the measures that need to be implemented going forward. Four such instances of
    cyber security breaches are highlighted in this report. For Corporate or Institutional
