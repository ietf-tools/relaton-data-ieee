abstract:
- content: It has been widely recognized that there is a distinct need for preferred
    voltage ratings for aircraft direct-current electric apparatus which will be generally
    acceptable to manufacturers and users to serve as a basis for voltage standards
    for aircraft systems and equipment. Many difficulties and much confusion will
    be eliminated by adopting suitable standard voltage ratings for all aircraft electric
    equipment. These standard voltages should then be made a part of specifications
    and nameplates marked accordingly. Apparatus should be designed for satisfactory
    operation over the voltage ranges given in the table, but with performance not
    necessarily the same as guaranteed at rated voltage. Performance data and acceptance
    tests should be on the basis of standard voltages. It is recognized that special
    applications may require operation over other voltage ranges than those shown
    as standard.
