abstract:
- content: A review of generally accepted applications and coordination of protection
    for radial power system distribution lines is presented. The Guide examines the
    advantages and disadvantages of schemes presently being used in protecting distribution
    lines. Identification of problems with the methods used in distribution line protection
    and the solutions for those problems are included.
