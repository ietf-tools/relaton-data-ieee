abstract:
- content: This document is based on IEC Publication 270-1968, Partial Discharge Measurements.
    adheres closely to the IEC recommendations with the following exceptions:(1) The
    terms partial discharge energy and partial discharge power are not used in this
    document but are defined for future reference.(2) Likewise, the corona discharge
    reference source shown in Fig 5 of the IEC document has been omitted since it
    is not in common use in the United States.(3) An Appendix concerning calibration
    techniques has been added since it is felt that the IECrecommendation is lacking
    in this respect.
