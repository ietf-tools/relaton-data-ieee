abstract:
- content: This standard defines a method to validate computational electromagnetics
    (CEM) computer modeling and simulation (M&S) techniques, codes, and models. It
    is applicable to a wide variety of electromagnetic (EM) applications including
    but not limited to the fields of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), radar cross
    section (RCS), signal integrity (SI), and antennas. Validation of a particular
    solution data set can be achieved by comparison to the data set obtained by measurements,
    alternate codes, canonical, or analytic methods.
