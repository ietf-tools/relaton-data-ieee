abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    (PoC) medical device communication, a communication protocol specification for
    a distributed system of PoC medical devices and medical IT systems that need to
    exchange data, or safely control networked PoC medical devices by profiling Web
    Service specifications, is defined by this standard. Additional Web Service specifications
    are part of this standard.
