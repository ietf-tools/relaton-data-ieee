abstract:
- content: Artificial intelligence (AI) computing differs from generic computing in
    terms of device formation, operators, and usage. AI server systems, including
    AI server, cluster, and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures are designed
    specifically for this purpose. The performance of these infrastructures is important
    to users not only on generic models but also on the ones for specific domains.
    Formal methods for the performance benchmarking for AI server systems are provided
    in this standard, including approaches for test, metrics, and measure. In addition,
    the technical requirements for benchmarking tools are discussed.
