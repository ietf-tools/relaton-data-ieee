abstract:
- content: This standard applies to single-phase instrument transformers of a nominal
    system voltage of 115 kV and above with capacitive insulation system for line-to-ground
    connection and for both indoor and outdoor application. This standard is intended
    for use as a supplement to IEEE Std C57.13 and as a basis for performance and
    safety of equipment. It also describes test sequences, criteria, methods and documentation
    for the test
