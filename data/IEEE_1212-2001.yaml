abstract:
- content: Administratively withdrawn January 2007 A common bus architecture (which
    includes functional components--modules, nodes,and units--and their address space,
    transaction set, CSRs, and configuration information) suitablefor both parallel
    and serial buses is provided in this standard. Bus bridges are enabled by the
    archi-tecture, but their details are beyond its scope. Configuration information
    is self- administered byvendors and organizations based upon IEEE Registration
    Authority company_id.
