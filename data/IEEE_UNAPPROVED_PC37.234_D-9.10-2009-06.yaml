abstract:
- content: Concepts of power bus protection are discussed in this guide. Consideration
    is given to availability and location of breakers, current transformers and disconnectors
    as well as bus switching scenarios, and their impact on selection and application
    of bus protection. A number of bus protection schemes are presented; their adequacy,
    complexity, strengths and limitations with respect to variety of bus arrangements
    are discussed; specific application guidelines are provided. Breaker failure protection
    is discussed as pertaining to bus protection. Means of securing bus protection
    schemes against corrupted relay input signals are also included.
