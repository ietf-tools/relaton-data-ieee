abstract:
- content: With the innovation of mobile applications and the arrival of the fifth
    generation of telecommunication, edge computing has become a popular scheme due
    to its geographical proximity to end users. The overall architecture has the advantage
    of lower latency and improved user experience. However, because of physical limitations,
    management and orchestration in the edge system is necessary to maintain operations,
    common functions, and application lifecycle. Accordingly, a standardized, orchestration-wise
    design to simplify the process and offer better system performance and user experience
    was introduced by the IEEE P1935 working group. The framework, architecture, and
    procedures of the edge-fog system as well as its application lifecycle management
    are involved in this standard.
