abstract:
- content: With the innovation of mobile applications and the arrival of fifth generation
    of telecommunication, edge computing has become a popular scheme due to its geographical
    proximity to end users; thus, the overall architecture has the advantage of lower
    latency and higher user experience. However, because of the physical limitation,
    management and orchestration in the edge system is necessary in order to maintain
    operations, common functionalities and application lifecycle. Accordingly, the
    IEEE P1935 working group introduced a standardized, orchestration- wise design
    to simplify the process and offer better system performance and user experience.
    This standard involves the framework, architecture, and procedures of the Edge/Fog
    system as well as its application lifecycle management.
