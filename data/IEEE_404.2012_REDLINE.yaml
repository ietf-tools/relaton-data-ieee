abstract:
  content: Electrical ratings and test requirements of cable joints used with extruded
    and laminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from
    2.5 kV to 500 kV are established in this standard. In addition, test requirements
    for joint metallic-shield and jacketing components are defined. A variety of common
    joint constructions are also defined. This standard has been designed to provide
    uniform testing procedures that can be used by manufacturers and users to evaluate
    the ability of underground power cable joints, and associated metallic-shields
    and jacketing components, to perform reliably in service.
