abstract:
- content: 'Conformance checks for extensible Markup Language (XML) data designed
    to describe electronic systems are formulated by this standard. The meta-data
    forms that are standardized include: components, systems, bus interfaces and connections,
    abstractions of those buses, and details of the components including address maps,
    register and field descriptions, and file set descriptions for use in automating
    design, verification, documentation, and use flows for electronic systems. A set
    of XML schemas of the form described by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C&#174;)
    and a set of semantic consistency rules (SCRs) are included. A generator interface
    that is portable across tool environments is provided. The specified combination
    of methodology-independent meta-data and the tool-independent mechanism for accessing
    that data provides for portability of design data, design methodologies, and environment
    implementations.'
