abstract:
- content: This standard defines a PHY and MAC layer for short-range optical wireless
    communications using visible light in optically transparent media. The visible
    light spectrum extends from 380 to 780 nm in wavelength. The standard is capable
    of delivering data rates sufficient to support audio and video multimedia services
    and also considers mobility of the visible link, compatibility with visible-light
    infrastructures, impairments due to noise and interference from sources like ambient
    light and a MAC layer that accommodates visible links. The standard will adhere
    to any applicable eye safety regulations
