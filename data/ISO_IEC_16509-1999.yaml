abstract:
- content: 'This standard provides concepts, definitions, remediation techniques,
    and other support- ing terms fundamental to a lexicon for Year 2000 terminology.
    It addresses key topics pertinent to the development of resolutions to the Year
    2000 problem. The core of this standard is the definitions Clause which contains
    the definition for Year 2000 compliance. Two critical aspects of this definition
    are: first, the acknowledgment of the significance of documentation associated
    with technology, and, second, the recognition that compliance is a two-way street,
    i.e., the proper exchange of date data is paramount for technology to remain compliant.'
