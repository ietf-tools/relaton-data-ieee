abstract:
- content: This standard is concerned with measurements of the quantities which characterize
    a waveguide or waveguide component and the associated electromagnetic fields.
    The term "waveguide" as used here, is a generic term which includes transmission
    lines and uniconductor waveguides as special cased. The measurement are described
    in general terms. For the specif details of procedure and equipment, the reader
    is directed to numerous references which form an indispensable part of the standard.
