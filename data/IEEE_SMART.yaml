abstract:
- content: The scope of this document is focused on computing technologies and the
    role they will play in the future electric grid. The computing technologies identified
    by the Computer Society Smart Grid Vision Project (CS-SGVP) team span many computing
    disciplines and do not necessarily represent all technologies that will shape
    the Smart Grid. Various projections of how Smart Grid concepts will influence
    power systems were considered. These projections span bulk transmission systems
    to isolated islands of local generation, as well as different demand side participation
    concepts. For Corporate or Institutional Access, request a custom quote for your
