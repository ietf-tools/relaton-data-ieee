abstract:
- content: 'This document, IEEE Smart Grid Vision for Computing: 2030 and Beyond Reference
    Model introduces the concepts and structure of the more detailed IEEE Smart Grid
    Vision for Computing: 2030 and Beyond and IEEE Smart Grid Vision for Computing:
    2030 and Beyond Roadmap that together provide Smart Grid architectural concepts,
    functional concepts, and technological concepts that describe the time-phased
    role of computing that enable Smart Grid functions. The content and examples in
    this reference model ultimately provide energy systems professionals and computing
    technologists assistance in the use of the Vision documents, facilitating investment
    decisions, and fostering advancements in the Smart Grid. For Corporate or Institutional
