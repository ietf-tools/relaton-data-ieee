abstract:
- content: 'Vehicle electrification is envisioned to be a significant component of
    the forthcoming Smart Grid. In this document, a Smart Grid vision of electric
    vehicle technology for the next 30 years and beyond is presented from six different
    perspectives: 1) social, economic, and political implications, 2) intelligent
    vehicles and grid interaction, 3) infrastructure, 4) travelers, 5) communications,
    and 6) systems, operations, and scenarios. Following the chapters focusing on
    these distinct perspectives, conclusive remarks will overview the interconnections
    among all chapters. Discussions of key technologies dictating the real future
    of the evolution of vehicle electrification will also be included. For Corporate
