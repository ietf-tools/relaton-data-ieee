    dedicated focus. However,several issues are discussed in multiple chapters. Considering
    the overlap of each chapter, thisroadmap is categorized into the following four
    groups: Penetration models Vehicle grid interaction High-order functions in EV
    Surrounding of EV. Most items covered in this roadmap are presented in IEEE Smart
    Grid Vision for VehicularTechnology: 2030 and Beyond and are arranged into the
    four categories above. In addition totopics from the base document, some topics
    are newly discussed in this document.For Corporate or Institutional Access, request
