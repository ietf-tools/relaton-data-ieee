abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Smart Grid Vision for Computing: 2030 and Beyond provides the results
    of the IEEE Computer Society Smart Grid Vision Project (CS-SGVP), chartered to
    develop Smart Grid visions looking forward as far as 30 years into the future.
    The purpose of these visions is to stimulate investments in computing (technology
    research and development, standards, and education) that will enable realization
    of Smart Grid goals. This document, IEEE Smart Grid Vision for Computing: 2030
    and Beyond Roadmap, provides a time-phased evolution of Smart Grid characteristics
    and computing technologies described in the computing vision report across near-term
    (0-5 years), mid-term (6-15 years), and long-term (15+ years) periods. (For Corporate
