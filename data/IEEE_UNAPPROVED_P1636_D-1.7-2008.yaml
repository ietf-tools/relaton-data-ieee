abstract:
- content: This document provides an implementation independent specification for
    a software interface to information systems containing data pertinent to the diagnosis
    and maintenance of complex systems consisting of hardware, software, or any combination
    thereof. These interfaces will support service definitions for creating application
    programming interfaces (API) for the access, exchange, and analysis of historical
    diagnostic and maintenance information. This will address the pervasive need of
    organizations to assess the effectiveness of diagnostics for complex systems throughout
    the product lifecycle. The use of formal information models will facilitate exchanging
    historical maintenance information between information systems and analysis tools.
    The models will facilitate creating open system software architectures for maturing
    system diagnostics.
