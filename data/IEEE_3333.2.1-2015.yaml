abstract:
- content: The generation and practical use of medical three-dimensional (3D) modeling
    for diagnostics and therapeutic applications is described in this standard. Volume
    rendering and surface rendering techniques for 3D reconstruction from two-dimensional
    (2D) medical images and a texturing method of 3D medical data for realistic visualization
    are included.
