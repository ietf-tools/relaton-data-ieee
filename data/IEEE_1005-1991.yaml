abstract:
- content: An introduction to the physics unique to this type of memory and an overview
    of typical array architectures are presented. The variations on the basic floating
    gate nonvolatile cell structure that have been used in commercially available
    devices are described. The various reliability considerations involved in these
    devices are explored. Retention and endurance failures and the interaction between
    endurance, retention, and standard semiconductor failure mechanisms in determining
    the device failure rate are covered. How to specify and perform engineering verification
    of retention of data stored in the arrays is described. Effects that limit the
    endurance of the arrays are discussed. The specification and engineering verification
    of endurance are described. The more common features incorporated into the arrays
    and methods for testing these complex products efficiently are addressed. The
    effects that various forms of ionizing radiation may have on floating gate arrays
    and approaches to test for these effects are covered. The use of floating gate
    cells in nonmemory applications is briefly considered.
