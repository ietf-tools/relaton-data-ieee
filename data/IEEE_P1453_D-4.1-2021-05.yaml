abstract:
- content: This standard provides background information on supply voltage fluctuations
    caused by fluctuations in power demands of installations. This standard presents
    the manifestation of these supply voltage fluctuations as lamp flicker. The standard
    presents a flicker measurement method using a meter that is described in IEC 61000-4-15.
    This standard defines the short-term (Pst) and long-term (Plt) indices used for
    the quantification of lamp flicker. For different system voltages, this standard
    defines planning levels for flicker that the utilities need their system to be
    limited to in order to avoid customer complaints. This standard defines the procedure
    for determining emission limits for individual installations at the Point of Common
    Coupling (PCC) so that the planning levels can be achieved in practice. Then,
    an assessment procedure for evaluating flicker compliance against emission limits
    is described. This standard also presents methodologies to analyze background
    flicker to identify the flicker contribution of individual sources. This standard
    also addresses rapid voltage changes (RVCs) that are caused by various system
    events such as switching of capacitor banks, energization of power transformers
    and starting of induction motors. The document provides methods to estimate flicker
    or RVCs at the PCC for various types of fluctuating installations. The document
    includes example terms and language that can be the basis for defining relative
    responsibilities and assessment methods for installations that may cause flicker
    and RVCs.
