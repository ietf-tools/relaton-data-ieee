abstract:
- content: Guidance and implementation procedures for this and other standards in
    the IEEE 1680¿ family of standards are provided. A clear and consistent set of
    environmental performance criteria for the design of personal computer products
    including notebook computers, desktop computers, and computer displays is provided,
    thereby providing an opportunity to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce
    the environmental impact of electronic products. This standard is intended to
    provide a tool for government, institutional, and corporate purchasers. Product
    manufacturers may also use this tool to earn recognition in the consumer market,
    recognizing that certain criteria may not be applicable to all types of purchasers.
    This standard shall be updated and revised on a periodic basis to continue to
    set a higher performance standard for leadership products.
