abstract:
- content: The ac/dc substation control equipment, pole control equipment, protection
    equipment, and auxiliary secondary equipment of high-voltage direct-current (HVDC)
    transmission systems are the focus of this guide. Based on analyzing the existing
    HVDC transmission projects, specifications for structure, configuration, performance
    and test of HVDC control and protection equipment, which could be applied to HVDC
    transmission system with the voltage range up to and including 800 kV are provided
    in this guide.
