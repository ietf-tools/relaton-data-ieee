abstract:
- content: 'The interface and functional specifications of cellular communication
    terminals installed on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are presented in this recommended
    practice. The specifications are described in four categories: the terminals’
    interface and functional specifications, specifications of data transmission,
    environmental and reliability specifications, and safety practices. The terminals’
    functional specifications include power management, cellular network communication,
    flight data and payload data collection, procession and transmission, device management,
    and safety management. The terminals’ interface specifications are the specifications
    of the electrical interface and electromechanical interface. The electrical interface
    refers to the power supply interface, communication interface, human-machine interface,
    and antenna interface. Data transmission is the flight data and payload data transmission
    protocols and terminals’ payload data safety practice. Finally, the terminals’
    interface environmental, reliability, and electromagnetic compatibility are presented.'
