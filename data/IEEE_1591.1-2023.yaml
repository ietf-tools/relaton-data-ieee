abstract:
- content: Hardware performance, test requirements, procedures, and acceptance criteria
    for a transmission line overhead ground wire (also known as shield wire, static
    wire, earth wire, and sky wire) with optical fibers commonly known as optical
    ground wire (OPGW) are covered. Functional requirements--such as electrical, mechanical,
    optical fiber, environmental, and test requirements related to design, installation,
    in service, and maintenance, including routine tests--are included.
