abstract:
- content: Considered in this guide are the components of both the ac and dc systems
    and the provided guidelines and recommendations for designing the appropriate
    systems for the substation under consideration. This guide includes the low-voltage
    auxiliary systems from the source(s) to the distribution point(s). Reliability
    requirements and load characteristics are discussed and distribution methods are
    recommended.
