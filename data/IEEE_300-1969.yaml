abstract:
- content: Semiconductor radiation detectors have come into widespread use in recent
    years for detection and high-resolution spectroscopy of ionizing radiation. Both
    silicon and germanium detectors have been developed, with silicon finding its
    principal application in the detection and analysis of heavy charged particles.
    Germanium detectors with their relatively high atomic number (as compared with
    silicon) and with large sensitive volumes have come into widespread use in the
    detection and analysis of gamma radiation. The rapid development and utilization
    of these detectors have made desirable standard test procedures so that measurements
    may have the same meaning to all manufacturers and users. This Test Procedure
    is not intended to imply that all tests described herein are mandatory, but only
    that such tests as are carried out on completed devices should be performed in
    accordance with the procedures given. A companion document is "Test Procedure
    for Amplifiers and Preamplifiers for Semiconductor Radiation Detectors," IEEE
    Standards Publication No. 301.
