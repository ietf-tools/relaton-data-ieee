abstract:
- content: This standard establishes test methods and test objects 1 for measuring
    the imaging performance of active millimeter wave (MMW) radio frequency systems
    for security screening of humans. This standard applies to security screening
    systems that inspect people who are not inside vehicles, containers, or enclosures.
    Specifically, this standard applies to systems used to detect objects carried
    on the body of the individual being screened. The purpose of this standard is
    to provide standard test objects and methods of evaluating and reporting imaging
    quality characteristics. The quality of the data that are used for automated threat
    recognition is the primary concern.
