abstract:
- content: The Standards of AIEE, NEMA, and ASA plus the purchaser's specifications
    determine the specific requirements for impulse tests. This Guide will not change
    the Standards in any way, but adds background information which will aid in the
    interpretation and application of these Standards. These Standards now provide
    for some alternate ways of conducting some tests or parts of tests. These alternates
    have been developed by different testing laboratories with consideration for their
    individual problems of transformer design, test facilities, etc. It is the object
    of this Guide to discuss these differences and to show how effective failure detection
    can be achieved with the testing techniques employed. Although the Guide is written
    primarily for power transformers, it is applicable generally to distribution and
    instrument transformers.
