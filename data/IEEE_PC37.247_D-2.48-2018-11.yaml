abstract:
- content: A phasor data concentrator (PDC) is defined in this standard as a set of
    functions that may be performed on synchrophasor data. It describes the PMU measurement
    network and indicates the place of the PDC in it. The standard defines the minimum
    functions that a PDC should perform. The performance requirements for these functions
    are given, and the ways they can be tested are described. Cybersecurity is discussed,
    and while its importance is acknowledged in the overall system, it is beyond the
    scope of this standard, which is viewed as specific to PDC functions.
