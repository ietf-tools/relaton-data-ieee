abstract:
- content: The traction and electric braking function of high-speed electric multiple
    units (EMUs) can be realized by the electric traction system. It is the core system
    of high-speed EMUs and mainly composed of traction transformer, traction converter,
    and traction motor. The service conditions, system configuration, technical requirements,
    and tests and their methods for electric traction system on board high-speed EMUs
    are specified by this standard.
