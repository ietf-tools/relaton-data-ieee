abstract:
- content: The Standard for Biometric Privacy (SBP) provides private identity assertion.
    SBP supersedes the prior IEEE Std 2410(TM)-2019 by including a formal specification
    for privacy and biometrics such that a conforming SBP system does not incur GDPR,
    CCPA, BIPA or HIPAA privacy obligations. Homomorphic encryption ensures the biometric
    payload is always one-way encrypted with no need for key management and provides
    full privacy by ensuring plaintext biometrics are never received by the SBP server.
    The SBP implementation includes software running on a client device and on the
    SPB server. Pluggable components are used to replace legacy functionality to allow
    rapid integration into existing operating environments. The SBP implementation
    allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming
    interface, whether the underlying system is a relational database management system
    or a search engine. The SBP implementation functionality offers a “point-and-cut”
    mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as
    to the systems in development. The architecture is language neutral, allowing
    Representational State Transfer (REST ), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide the communication interface. This document
    describes the essential methodology to SBP.
