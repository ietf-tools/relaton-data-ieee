abstract:
- content: Superseded by 112-1991. Instructions are given for conducting and reporting
    the more generally applicable and acceptable tests to determine the performance
    characteristics of polyphase induction motors and generators. Electrical measurements,
    performance testing, temperature tests, and miscellaneous tests are covered.
