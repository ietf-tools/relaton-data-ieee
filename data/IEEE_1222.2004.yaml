abstract:
- content: 'SUMMARY: This standard covers construction, mechanical, electrical, and
    optical performance, installation guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements,
    environmental considerations, and accessories for an all-dielectric, non-metallic,
    self-supporting fiber optic (ADSS) cable. The ADSS cable is designed to be located
    primarily on overhead utility facilities. This standard provides both construction
    and performance requirements that insure within the guidelines of the standard
    that the dielectric capabilities of the cable components and maintenance of optical
    fiber integrity and optical transmissions are proper.'
