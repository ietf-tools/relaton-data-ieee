abstract:
- content: The paper outlines the pre-standardization study for Indian Languages and
    explains the outcome of that study, the result of which is four additional papers.
    This series of documents is a pre-standardization study focusing on identifying
    the gaps in the standards. The series does not offer any recommendation on prioritization
    of the gaps nor defines any standards to address the identified gaps. The study
    covers only the listed 22 scheduled languages. The series offers no comments on
    the validity of its content for the non-scheduled languages. However, readers
    are free to take the contents and apply them to the non-scheduled languages.
