abstract:
- content: 3D scanning is a process that captures the three-dimensional attributes
    of an object and includes surface texture and spectral content. 3D scanners have
    become a critical tool for shortening product development and manufacturing time.
    The ongoing technological advancements in terms of portability, scanning range,
    and image quality have opened new application areas for 3D scanning. However,
    3D scanning appears to be primarily dependent on users. Innovation in technology
    and application software, as well as growing and diverse connectivity, are leading
    3D scanners to become a more integral element in the overall value chain. This
    notwithstanding, interoperability, data security and privacy, quality, portability,
    and trustworthiness are opportunities to be realized. The intent of this white
    paper is to highlight areas of opportunity for standard development organizations,
    specifically the IEEE P3141 Working Group, to focus on and further enable broad
    market use for the various sectors and users.
