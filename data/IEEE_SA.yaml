abstract:
- content: This paper provides a brief overview of some important functional anatomy
    terms and concepts from a medical perspective. The scope of this paper is not
    to serve as a comprehensive review of all the factors that are important in footwear
    design but to introduce functional anatomical and biomechanical terms and concepts
    along with a brief discussion of the most common foot conditions and their relevance
    to the health implications of footwear. This paper is considered a companion paper
    to IEEE SA 3D Body Processing Industry Connections Comprehensive Review of Foot
    Measurements Terminology in Use paper. Footwear has been customized to address
    pain and pathology since shoes were first worn. Medical professionals (and some
    bespoke footwear manufacturers) currently provide this service for those with
    foot pathology but the emerging technologies will enable more access to custom
    footwear on a dramatically larger scale. Many early adopters of mass customized
    footwear will likely have foot conditions that have not been satisfactorily addressed
    with off?the?shelf shoes. Footwear manufacturers and retailers cannot be expected
    to diagnose and treat medical conditions but nevertheless, those providing custom
    footwear will need a basic understanding of some anatomical and biomechanical
    concepts. To follow are sections on terminology, functional anatomy, biomechanics,
    and common conditions of the feet. The terms and concepts discussed in this paper
    can be found in most medical textbooks on anatomy and the musculoskeletal system.
    The references used for this overview are listed at the end of the paper and numbered
    as [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
