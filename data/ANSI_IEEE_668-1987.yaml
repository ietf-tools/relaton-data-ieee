abstract:
- content: The provisions of this recommended practice apply to (a) All electrical
    equipment and wiring between the point of connection in the power supply substation
    and the connection to the furnace or forehearth electrodes for the purpose of
    heating the glass by the passing of electric current through it. (2) All electrical
    equipment and wiring that is connected directly to resistance heating devices
    that supply energy to the furnace of forehearth. (3) All sensors and devices used
    to measure, alarm, or regulate energy, mass flow, and temperature. (4) The adequate
    electrical insulation from ground of the refractories containg the molten glass.
    (5) The adequate electrical grounding og equipment and services. (6) All equipment
    and procedures pertaining to safeguarding personnel.
