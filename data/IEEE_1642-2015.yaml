abstract:
- content: Appropriate electromagnetic threat levels, protection methods, monitoring
    techniques, and test techniques for specific classes of computer equipment are
    established. This equipment is expected to be accessible to the public at ranges
    less than 100 m, and the loss of operation of the equipment due to intentional
    electromagnetic interference is expected to cause losses (both financial and of
    confidence) to businesses operating computer equipment, which are providing services
    to the public or to private companies. The principle class of equipment to be
    considered in this recommended practice includes fixed (non-mobile) computer equipment.
    Examples include automated teller machines; electronic cash registers at stores;
    computer equipment in banks and at airports; computer equipment controlling traffic
    flow; computer equipment controlling communications or allowing Internet access;
    computer equipment providing police, fire, and security services; computer equipment
    controlling the operation of the power grid (including smart meters); computer
    equipment operating in hospitals; etc.
