abstract:
- content: Withdrawn Standard. The primary application of this standard is intended
    to be in the field of routine operational and maintenance tests, where rapid interpretation
    and communication of test results is necessary or desirable. The basic techniques
    described here are also applicable to laboratory measurements, proof-of-performance
    test, and detailed maintenance procedures.
