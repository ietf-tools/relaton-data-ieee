abstract:
- content: Small power transformers have become a significant element in distribution
    systems supplying large commercial customers like major resort hotels and site-specific
    industrial customers that desire the local utility to own, operate, and maintain
    the serving transformer. These transformers can range in sizes from 112.5 kVA
    to 10 000 kVA with primary voltages at 69 000 V and below and secondary voltages
    from 34 500 V to 120 V. Transformers in this standard are generally for larger
    distribution customers often with special voltages or installation requirements
    like convention centers with large chiller plants and extensive exhibit space.
    There is often a desire to serve these transformers from underground systems using
    side-mounted bushings on the primary. This standard seeks to define the small
    power transformer that is applied as more than just a limited scope version of
    the power transformers covered by IEEE Std C57.12.10 and as more than a large
    distribution class transformer covered by IEEE Std C57.12.34.
