abstract:
- content: Test procedures for X-ray spectrometers consisting of a semiconductor radiation
    detector assembly and signal processing electronics interfaced to a pulse-height
    analyzer/computer are presented. Energy resolution, spectral distortion, pulse-height
    linearity, counting rate effects, overload effects, pulse-height stability, and
    efficiency are covered. Test procedures for pulse-height analyzers and computers
    are not covered.
