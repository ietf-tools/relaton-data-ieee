abstract:
- content: This recommended practice describes interconnections that need to be understood
    and evaluated when buying, building, testing, or using computer-aided software
    engineering (CASE) tools. CASE tools are developed for use in creating computing
    systems. By assisting users to reach a clear understanding of the context of operation
    for a computing system tool, this recommended practice contributes to the effective
    implementation and application of computing system tools. This recommended practice
    does not describe the processes of evaluating, acquiring, or adopting CASE tools.
    This recommended practice is limited to the technical aspects of CASE tools. It
    does not include issues in the management, marketing, or training domains.
