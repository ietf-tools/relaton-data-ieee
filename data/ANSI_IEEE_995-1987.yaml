abstract:
- content: This recommended practice proposes a method for determining the efficiency
    of large, adjustable-speed AC motor-drive systems consisting of a load commutated
    inverter and a synchronous machine, in which a DC-linked converter is connected
    between the line and the load. This recommended practice is directed primarily
    to high-capacity systems (exceeding 1000 hp) and drive systems, which normally
    include equipments such as transformers, reactors, thyristor power converters,
    and synchronous machines. The method recommends that the existing test standards
    for the system equipments be used as reference, supplemented by test and calculations
    include herein to account for operating characteristics of the adjustable-speed
    drive systems.<<ETX>>
