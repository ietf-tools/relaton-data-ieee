abstract:
- content: The aim of this recommended practice is establishing a protocol for the
    measurement of space charges in High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) extruded cables
    having rated voltage up to 550 kV. Such measurements are prescribed to be carried
    out at the beginning and at the end of load cycle qualification tests (either
    the long duration voltage test of prequalification tests or the load cycle test
    of type tests). The various steps of the protocol for the measurement of space
    charges in such cables are carefully described. Details are given about the procedure
    for applying and switching of the voltage, the preparation and conditioning of
    specimens, the measurement times during poling and depolarization, the calculations
    for checking electric field stabilization. The ultimate goal of this recommended
    practice is not verifying the compliance with any maximum acceptable limit of
    either space charge or electric field, but rather assessing the variation of the
    electric field profile in the cable insulation wall during load cycle qualification
    tests.
