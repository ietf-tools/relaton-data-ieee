abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1220-2005 The interdisciplinary tasks, which are required
    throughout a systemÕs life cycle to trans-form customer needs, requirements, and
    constraints into a system solution, are defined. In addition,the requirements
    for the systems engineering process and its application throughout the productlife
    cycle are specified. The focus of this standard is on engineering activities necessary
    to guideproduct development while ensuring that the product is properly designed
    to make it affordable toproduce, own, operate, maintain, and eventually to dispose
    of, without undue risk to health or theenvironment.
