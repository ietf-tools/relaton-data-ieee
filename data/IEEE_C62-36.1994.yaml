abstract:
- content: Methods are established for testing and measuring the characteristics of
    surge protectors used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits
    with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V rms or 1200 Vdc. The surge protectors
    are designed to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both. The surge protectors
    covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear
    elements. Tests are included for characterizing standby performance, surge-limiting
    capabilities, and surge lifetime. Packaged single gas-tube, air-gap, varistor,
    or avalanche junction surge-protective devices are not covered, nor are test methods
    for low-voltage power circuit applications.
