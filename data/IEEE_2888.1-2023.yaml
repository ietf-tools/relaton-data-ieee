- content: The vocabulary, data formats, and application programming interfaces (APIs)
    for acquiring information from sensors are defined in this standard, enabling
    communication between the cyber world and the physical world, including:--Data
    formats for interfacing sensor data defining a root schema with individual sensor
    data--Data formats for recognizing sensor capabilities defining a root schema
    with individual sensor capabilities--Data formats for common data types--Application
    programming interfaces to transmit a sensor and its capability data between cyber
    and physical worlds
