abstract:
- content: "(Amendment to IEEE Std 802.15.3-2003). This project will define a 25 to
    100 GHz (millimeter wave) alternative PHY clause for higher data rate amendment
    to Standard 802.15.3-2003. This frequency range allows for the USA and Japanese
    unlicensed allocations and expected unlicensed allocations in other countries.
    Data rates will be at least 1 Gbps under normal operating conditions with a typical
    range no less than 10 meters."
