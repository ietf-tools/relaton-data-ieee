abstract:
- content: Guidance to developers of IEEE Std 1232-conformant applications is provided
    in this guide. A simple doorbell is used as an example system under test to illustrate
    how the static model constructs of Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service
    Tie to All Test Environments (AI-ESTATE) are used to form a diagnostic reasoner
    knowledge base. Each of AI-ESTATE’s knowledge base types is discussed in conceptual
    terms, and how those concepts are represented in exchange files is shown. Also,
    some of the nuanced aspects of diagnostic knowledge bases in AI-ESTATE are clarified.
    An example reasoner session is provided to illustrate the use of AI-ESTATE services.
