abstract:
- content: Definitions used for measurement of electric power quantities under sinusoidal,
    nonsinusoidal, balanced, or unbalanced conditions are provided in this standard.
    Mathematical expressions that were used in the past, as well as new expressions,
    are listed, as well as explanations of the features of the new definitions.
