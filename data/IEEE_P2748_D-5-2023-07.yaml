abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides the fault diagnosis and protection schemes
    and application cases for smart distribution systems from AC 6 kV to 20 kV, covering
    security requirements, architectures, and configuration, as well as basic functions
    and technical indexes of software systems and hardware terminals, and requirements
    of information exchange. Schemes provided in this document are adaptable to various
    grid operation modes, control patterns, equipment conditions, and reliability
    requirements of distribution systems. This recommended practice is mainly based
    on engineering practices in the voltage range of 6 kV-20 kV. The proposed FLISR
    schemes can also be used in the voltage range of 2.4 kV - 38 kV as specified in
    ANSI C84.1 after an evaluation of communication conditions and cost analysis.
    The fault types cover phase (three-phase and phase-to-phase) faults, ground (three-phase-to-ground,
    two-phase-to-ground and single-phase-to-ground) faults and conductor-broken faults.Changes
    and needs brought by the connection of distributed generators are considered.
    And schemes empowered by information and communication technologies are also introduced.
