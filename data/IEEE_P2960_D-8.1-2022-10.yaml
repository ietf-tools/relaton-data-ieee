abstract:
- content: This guide applies to stationary Meter Test Units (MTUs) permanently installed
    in laboratories, used for testing and calibration of direct current electrical
    energy meters, in particular for their type test, acceptance test and verification
    test. It covers the requirements for automatic MTUs and applies to newly manufactured
    MTUs to test electrical energy meters on direct current systems with a voltage
    up to 1 500 V. Finally, it should be noted that the entire guide does not contain
    normative requirements.
