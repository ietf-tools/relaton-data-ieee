abstract:
- content: Stationary Meter Test Units (MTUs) permanently installed in laboratories,
    used for testing and calibration of direct current electrical energy meters, in
    particular for their type test, acceptance test, and verification test, are applied
    to in this guide. The requirements for automatic MTUs and applies to newly manufactured
    MTUs to test electrical energy meters on direct current systems with a voltage
    up to 1 500 V is covered. Finally, it should be noted that the entire guide does
    not contain normative requirements
