abstract:
- content: Information on the application of underfrequency load shedding and restoration
    to ac power systems is compiled in this guide. Various system conditions that
    may require the use of underfrequency load shedding and the application of protective
    relays to various methods of performing underfrequency load shedding are described
    in this guide. Some practical examples of underfrequency load shedding applications
    are also provided.
