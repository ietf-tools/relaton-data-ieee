abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care
    (PoC) medical device communication, an architecture for service-oriented distributed
    PoC medical devices and medical IT systems is defined. This standard defines a
    binding of the Participant, Discovery, and Communication Model defined in IEEE
    Std 11073-10207(TM) to the profile for transport over Web Services defined in
    IEEE Std 11073-20702(TM). Moreover, a binding to Network Time Protocol (NTP) and
    Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is defined for time synchronization and transport
    Quality of Service requirements.
