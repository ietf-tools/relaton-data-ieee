abstract:
- content: Performance criteria and characterization techniques are established in
    this standard for radiation measurement systems incorporated onto unmanned aerial
    systems. This standard focuses on radiation response expectations and environmental
    parameters that could be experienced during use such as temperature changes, mechanical
    shock, and onboard vibration. For radiation response expectations, response vectors
    include those expected from distributed radioactive contamination and from radioactive
    point sources. The primary unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of interest include
    those from Group 1 and Group 2 UAV designations.
