abstract:
- content: A method for measurement of soil thermal resistivity that is based on the
    theory that the rate of temperature rise of a line heat source is dependent upon
    the thermal constants of the medium in which it is placed is given. This information
    will enable the user to properly install and load underground cables. The aim
    is to provide sufficient information to enable the user to select useful commercial
    test equipment, or to manufacture equipment that is not readily available on the
    market, and to make meaningful resistivity measurements with this equipment, in
    the field or on soil samples in the laboratory. Designs for both laboratory and
    field thermal needles are described.
