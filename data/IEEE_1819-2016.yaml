abstract:
- content: 'This standard addresses the following: Risk-informed methods have been
    established to appropriately categorize components as either safety significant
    or low safety significant. Application of these methods has been shown to be safety-beneficial
    for existing nuclear power generating stations and nuclear facilities. No standardized
    approach currently exists for the detailed application of these methods to electrical
    and electronic components. The results of the categorization process are not easily
    integrated with traditional Class 1E/non-Class 1E classifications or the resulting
    treatment for these components. This standard provides methods to categorize electrical
    and electronic components using a risk-informed process and identifies how the
    categorization results relate to Class 1E/non-Class 1E classifications. This standard
    also provides a standardized and accepted method for alternate treatment of categorized
    components commensurate with their safety significance.'
