abstract:
- content: The use of some electrical equipment attached to typical power systems
    creates voltage quality concerns. There is an increasing awareness that some equipment
    is not designed to withstand the surges, faults, distortion, and reclosing duty
    present on typical utility distribution systems. Traditional concerns about steady-state
    voltage levels and light flicker due to voltage fluctuation also remain. These
    concerns are addressed by this guide by documenting typical levels of these aspects
    of voltage quality and indicating how to improve them. Other documents that treat
    these subjects in more detail are referenced.
