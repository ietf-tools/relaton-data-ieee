abstract:
- content: Instructions for conducting tests to determine the performance characteristics
    of permanent magnet (PM) machines are contained in this guide. Motors and generators
    may have the described tests applied as needed, and no attempt is made to partition
    this guide into clauses applying to motors and clauses applying to generators.
    It is not intended that all possible tests, or tests of a research nature, shall
    be covered by this guide but only those general methods that may be used to obtain
    the performance data. The schedule of factory and field tests, which may be required
    on new equipment, is normally specified by applicable standards or by contract
    specifications. This guide should not be interpreted as requiring any specific
    test in a given transaction or implying any guarantee as to specific performance
    indices or operating conditions.
