abstract:
  content: To describe a practical and reproducible method of determining the loudness
    ratings of telephone connections. Loudness ratings may be measured directly using
    appropriate test instruments and facilities, as specified in this standard, or
    may be computed using the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the connection
    measured in accordance with IEEE Std 269-1971. .
