abstract:
- content: Fundamental information on minimum environmental withstand conditions for
    space electronics is provided. The intent is to achieve uniformity and reproducibility
    in the test conditions for all spaceborne computer modules that may make up larger
    systems and are purported to have a rated environmental performance level. The
    specifications pertain to both the natural and artificial environments to which
    spaceborne computer modules may be exposed. These conditions include, but are
    not limited to, thermal, mechanical, electrical, and radiation stresses.
