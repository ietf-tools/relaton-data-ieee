abstract:
- content: Guidance for the designer/manufacturer/supplier in planning and implementing
    controls for the design and manufacture of lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-ion
    polymer (Li-ion polymer) rechargeable battery packs used for portable computing
    is provided. This standard's provisions work together, and they define approaches
    to design, test, and evaluate a cell, battery pack, and host device to mitigate
    battery system failure in user environments. Additionally, this standard provides
    recommendations for end-user education and communication materials. This approach
    suggests the interfaces between subsystems (e.g., cell, battery pack, host device)
    and end users are as important to system reliability as is robust subsystem design
    and testing. This standard therefore includes subsystem interface design responsibilities
    for each subsystem designer/ manufacturer/supplier, and it provides messaging
    and communication provisions for end-user awareness.
