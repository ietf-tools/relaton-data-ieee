abstract:
- content: This standard establishes criteria for design analysis for qualification,
    quality, and reliability of rechargeable battery systems for portable computing.
    It also provides methods for quantifying the operational performance of these
    batteries and their associated management and control systems, including considerations
    for end-user notification.
