abstract:
- content: This document provides continuation and further development of previous
    synchrophasor standards, notably the IEEE C37.118 series. It defines synchrophasor,
    frequency, and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) measurements as used in this
    technology. These definitions are in agreement with most research on and analysis
    of dynamic electric power system measurements, but may differ from those given
    in other contexts. Function and performance requirements are given for synchrophasor
    measurements. Tests, evaluation criteria, and error limits are provided to determine
    compliance with the requirements.
