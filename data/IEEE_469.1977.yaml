abstract:
- content: The practice described herein provides instruction on the testing of distribution
    transformers as voice-frequency noise generators, to measure the degree to which
    they may contribute to electrical noise in communication circuits that are in
    parallel with the power-supply circuits serving the transformers. Transformers
    have a characteristic common to other iron-core devices of causing harmonic currents
    at voice frequencies to flow in supply circuits to the transformers. The magnitudes
    of these currents, and of interference that may result, vary according to design
    of the transformer as well as excitation voltage. The tests described in this
    practice provide a standard method for use by the transformer manufacturer, user,
    and others in industry for the purpose of better evaluating the design choices
    available and moving toward industry objectives as to levels of harmonic exciting
    current expressed as I-T (current X telephone influence factor [TIF] ).
