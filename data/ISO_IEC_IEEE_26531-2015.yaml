abstract:
- content: This International Standard provides requirements for the management of
    the content used in product life cycle, software, and service management system
    documentation. Content management allows an organization to control the storage
    and retrieval of content objects, track content revisions, maintain a content
    audit trail, and enable a collaborative environment. Component content management
    supports the reuse of content objects among deliverables and supports multiple
    deliverable formats. Content objects that are unique and are maintained as independent
    database objects are efficient to review, approve, and update; may be combined
    to produce multiple deliverables; and are cost-effective to translate. The standard
    defines the characteristics of an effective and efficient process through which
    content is gathered, managed, and published, including the requirements of a system
    that is supported by an electronic database. Such a database should support documents
    or topics and content units that may be assembled to produce complete documents
    for print, electronic output, or content collections published through electronic
    media. This database is defined as a component content management system (CCMS),
    as distinct from a document management system. The objective of component content
    management is to create content objects once and use them through linking mechanisms
    in multiple output formats including but not limited to documents. Systems conforming
    to this standard can fulfill business needs for content development and management,
    especially the need for a single source of authoritative information. The standard
    includes business case considerations for acquisition of a content management
    system. This International Standard is independent of the software tools and markup
    languages that may be used to manage documentation content, and applies to both
    printed documentation and on-screen documentation.
