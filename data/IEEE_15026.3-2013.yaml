abstract:
- content: 'The concept of integrity levels with corresponding integrity level requirements
    that are required to be met in order to show the achievement of the integrity
    level are specified in this adoption of ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011. It places requirements
    on and recommends methods for defining and using integrity levels and their integrity
    level requirements, including the assignment of integrity levels to systems, software
    products, their elements, and relevant external dependences. This standard is
    applicable to systems and software and is intended for use by the following: Definers
    of integrity levels such as industry and professional organizations, standards
    organizations, and government agencies; Users of integrity levels such as developers
    and maintainers, suppliers and acquirers, users, and assessors of systems or software
    and for the administrative and technical support of systems and/or software products.
    One important use of integrity levels is by suppliers and acquirers in agreements;
    for example, to aid in assuring safety, economic, or security characteristics
    of a delivered system or product. This standard does not prescribe a specific
    set of integrity levels or their integrity level requirements. In addition, it
    does not prescribe the way in which integrity level use is integrated with the
    overall system or software engineering life cycle processes. This standard can
    be used alone or with other parts of ISO/IEC 15026. It can be used with a variety
    of technical and specialized risk analysis and development approaches. ISO/IEC
    TR 15026-1 provides additional information and references to aid users of IEEE
    Std 15026-3.'
