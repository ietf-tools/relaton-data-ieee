abstract:
- content: 'This international standard (standard) describes HVSC systems, on board
    the ship and on shore, to supply the ship with electrical power from shore. This
    standard is applicable to the design, installation and testing of HVSC systems
    and addresses: * HV shore distribution system, * shore-to-ship connection and
    interface equipment, * transformers/reactors, * semiconductor / rotating convertors,
    * ship distribution system, and * control, monitoring, interlocking and power
    management system. This standard does not apply to the electrical power supply
    during docking periods, e.g. dry docking and other out of service maintenance
    and repair. NOTE 1 Additional and/or alternative requirements may be imposed by
    the National Administration or Authorities within whose jurisdiction the ship
    is intended to operate and/or by the Owners or Authorities responsible for a shore
    supply or distribution system. NOTE 2 It is expected that HVSC systems will have
    practicable applications for ships requiring 1 MW or more or ships with HV main
    supply. NOTE 3 Low-voltage shore connection systems are not covered by this standard.'
