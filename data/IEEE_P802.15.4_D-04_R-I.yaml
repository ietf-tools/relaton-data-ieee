abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003 defined the protocol and compatible interconnection
    for data communication devices using low-data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity
    short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network
    (WPAN). This revision extends the market applicability of IEEE Std 802.15.4, removes
    ambiguities in the standard, and makes improvements revealed by implementations
    of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003
