abstract:
- content: This standard provides multisource and "plug and play" environment for
    the millions of metering devices in the field now and in the future using the
    telephone modem communication interface. It solves the problems associated with
    single-source systems and with multisource systems based upon proprietary communications
    protocols. Electric, water, and gas utilities and corresponding vendors can realize
    cost savings that ultimately shall benefit the client consumers of the utilities.
