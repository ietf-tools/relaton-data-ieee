abstract:
- content: Information is provided to specifiers and users of surge-protective devices
    (SPDs) about the application considerations of SPDs associated with power distribution
    systems within North America. This guide applies to SPDs to be connected to the
    load side of the service entrance main overcurrent protective device of 50 Hz
    or 60 Hz ac power circuits rated at 100V to 1000 V rms. The effects and side effects
    on the presence and operation of SPDs in low-voltage power distribution systems
    are described. The coordination of multiple SPDs on the same circuit is described.
