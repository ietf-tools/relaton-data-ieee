abstract:
- content: A suite of abstract test cases for verifying the conformance of products
    based on the Futurebus+ family of standards and a means of selecting the exact
    set of test cases necessary for testing any given product are provided. The test
    suite is abstract in that it was not created with a specific test environment
    in mind. It can be effectively used in conjunction with logic simulators during
    product development as well as with physical testers after prototype or production
    units are available. This standard is intended for use by Futurebus+ product suppliers
    and users and by independent test labs. Consistent use of this standard should
    promote comparability and, therefore, mutual recognition of test results produced
    by different testers.
