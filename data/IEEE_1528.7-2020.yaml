abstract:
- content: In the wireless communication field, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions
    are the main emerging technologies and future wireless communication will rely
    on them. A methodology for classifying IoT devices based on radio frequency (RF)
    exposure characteristics is provided. Classification is based on frequency, bandwidth,
    radiated power, and typical installation configuration. Links between device class
    and available measurement/computational standards are provided. A framework criterion
    for exclusion classes for exposure assessment and criteria for addressing situations
    where exposure assessment is unavailable are included.
