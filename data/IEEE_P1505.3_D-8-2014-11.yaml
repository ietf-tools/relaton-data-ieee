abstract:
- content: 'This document, the Standard for the Universal Test Interface Pin Map Configuration
    for portable and bench top test requirements utilizing IEEE Std 1505 represents
    an extension to the IEEE-1505 Receiver Fixture Interface (RFI) Standard Specifications1.Particular
    emphasis is placed on defining within the IEEE-P1505 RFI Standard a more specific
    set of performance requirements that employ a universal test interface: (a) pin
    map configuration;(b) specific connector modules; (c) respective contacts; and
    (d) recommended switching implementation. This is intentionally done to standardize
    the footprint and validate mechanical and electrical interoperability between
    Automatic Test Systems (ATS).'
