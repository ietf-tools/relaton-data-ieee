abstract:
- content: This document covers methods, techniques, and designs to mitigate bird-related
    power interruptions and equipment damage resulting from avian interactions with
    electric facilities. This document addresses electrocutions, collisions, nesting
    problems, and outages caused by fecal contamination and fecal streamers. The topics
    include bird impacts to transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations.
    Woodpecker issues are also addressed. It is believed that resolving these issues
    will improve system reliability and minimize revenue losses.
