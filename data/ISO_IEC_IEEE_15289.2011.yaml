abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2011 provides requirements for identifying and planning
    the specific information items (information products, documentation) to be developed
    and revised during systems and software life cycles and service processes. It
    specifies the purpose and content of all identified systems and software data
    records and life cycle information items, as well as records and information items
    for information technology service management. The information item contents are
    defined according to generic document types (description, plan, policy, procedure,
    report, request, and specification) and the specific purpose of the document.
    For simplicity of reference, each information item is described as if it were
    published as a separate document. However, information items may be unpublished
    but available in a repository for reference, divided into separate documents or
    volumes, or combined with other information items into one document. ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15289:2011 is based on the life cycle processes specified in ISO/IEC 12207:2008
    (IEEE Std 12207-2008) and ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008), and the service
    management processes specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2005 and ISO/IEC 20000-2:2005.
