abstract:
- content: Physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of an improved flexible
    channel wavelet (FCW) technology to be usable for communication on any media called
    extended flexible channel wavelet (FCW) PHY/MAC are specified in this amendment.
    New communication channels are defined in low-frequency bands to extend the communication
    range and increase the robustness of communication, and how the IEEE Std 1588
    precision time protocol (PTP) works over wavelet networks is specified to enhance
    network functions.
