abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides the fault diagnosis and protection schemes
    and application cases for smart distribution systems from AC 6 kV to 20 kV, covering
    security requirements, architectures, and configuration, as well as basic functions
    and technical indexes of software systems and hardware terminals, and requirements
    of information exchange. Schemes provided in this document are adaptable to various
    grid operation modes, control patterns, equipment conditions, and reliability
    requirements of distribution systems. The fault types involved contain short circuit,
    single-phase-to-ground, and single-phase conductor-broken. Changes and needs brought
    by the connection of distributed generators are considered. And schemes 8 empowered
    by information and communication technologies are also introduced.
