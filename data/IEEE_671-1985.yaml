abstract:
- content: A guide is presented for the preparation of a specification and test procedure
    for an inertial angular sensor that provides a common meeting ground of terminology
    and practice for manufacturers and users of an array of sensors that have been
    developed to meet needs not easily met by traditional spinning-rotor gyroscopes.
    A test procedure for verifying that the specifications have been met is given.
    The standard is not intended to compete with existing standards for specific devices
    with highly specific models and error sources, such as spring-restrained rate
    gyros, but to provide a uniform guide for those inertial angular sensors that
    have not been covered elsewhere.
