abstract:
- content: This is a standard for definitions used for measurement of electric power
    quantities under sinusoidal, nonsinusoidal, balanced, or unbalanced conditions.
    It lists the mathematical expressions that were used in the past, as well as new
    expressions, and explains the features of the new definitions.
