abstract:
- content: The steps and procedures a user should undertake to implement an IEC 61850
    substation in both a single and multi-vendor equipment environment are outlined
    in this recommended practice. Intelligent electronic device (IED) specification,
    procurement, configuration, and documentation to develop a general design philosophy
    that transforms the IEC 61850 standard are addressed in this recommended practice,
    using this as a practical working implementation guide. A general overview of
    an IEC 61850 implementation is given in this recommended practice. Future work
    may develop more detail behind the topics presented herein.
