abstract:
- content: Proper installation design and installation procedures are prerequisite
    to long and reliable serviceof large stationary lead storage batteries. A definite
    need exists within the industry for recommendations that provide a uniform method
    for the design of the installation and the installation procedures of all batteries
    to meet station requirements. However, to provide practices that can be used immediately
    (especially for nuclear power generating stations), this document will limit its
    scope to the installation design and installation procedures of large stationary
    lead storage batteries. Included will be the seismic considerations for new battery
    installations.
