abstract:
- content: Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are set
    forth as well as certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz., mineral-oil-immersed,
    self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers. These
    transformers are rated 5 MVA and smaller, with the high voltage limit of 34.5
    kV system nominal voltage and below, and with low voltage limit of 15 kV system
    nominal voltage and below. This standard covers the connector, bushing and terminal
    arrangements for radial or loop feed systems. This standard does not cover the
    electrical and mechanical requirements of any accessory devices that may be supplied
    with the transformer.
