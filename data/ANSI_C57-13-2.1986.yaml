abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to cover conformance test requirements
    for current and inductively coupled voltage transformers used for measurement
    and control functions in unit substations at primary system voltages above 600
    V, but not exceeding 38 kV. The report describes relevant performance tests to
    demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards. The test specimen is normally
    subjected to all planned routine tests prior to the initiation of the conformance
    test program.
