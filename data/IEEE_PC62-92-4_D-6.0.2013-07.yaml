abstract:
- content: The neutral grounding of single- a 1 nd three-phase ac electric utility
    primary distribution systems with nominal voltages in the range of 2.4 kV34.5
    kV is addressed. Classes of distribution systems grounding are defined. Basic
    considerations in distribution system groundingconcerning economics, control of
    temporary over-voltages, control of ground-fault currents, and ground relayingare
    addressed. Also considered is the use of grounding transformers, grounding of
    high-voltage neutral of wye-delta distribution transformers, and interconnection
    of primary and secondary neutrals of distribution transformers.
