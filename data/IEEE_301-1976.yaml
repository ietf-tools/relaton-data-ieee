abstract:
- content: This standard provides standard test procedures for amplifiers and preamplifiers
    for semiconductor detectors for ionizing radiation. It supersedes the previous
    edition, IEEE Std 301-1969 (ANSI N42.2-1969). The standard has been modified and
    refined based on the experience gained in using the earlier edition over a six-year
    period and taking into account advances in the technology. Improvements in preamplifier
    noise characteristics and pulse shaping techniques as well as increased utilization
    of integral detector-preamplifier assemblies have occurred in recent years.
