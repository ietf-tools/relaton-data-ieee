abstract:
- content: 'The standards in this section apply to the following types of rotating
    machines: 1. induction motors larger than fractional horse power; 2. induction
    generators, they are applicable also to induction machines in general. Alternating-current
    commutator motors are not covered in detail but they shall conform to these Standards
    as regards ratings, temperature rises and dielectric tests.'
