abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std C57.129-2007. The electrical, mechanical, and physical
    requirements of oil-immersed single-phase and three-phase converter transformers
    are specified in this standard. Tests are described and test code defined. Devices
    such as arc furnace transformers and rectifier transformers for industrial or
    locomotive applications are not covered.
