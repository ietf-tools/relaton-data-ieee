abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1920.1 defines air-to-air communications for self-organized ad
    hoc aerial networks. It outlines the network service architecture, security framework,
    and data model. IEEE Std 1920.1 is agnostic to the type of network (Wireless or
    Cellular or other) and it is applicable to manned and unmanned, small and large,
    and civil and commercial aircraft systems. IEEE Std 1920.1 is the first in the
    series of IEEE P1920.X standards. It is anticipated that IEEE Std 1920.1 will
    be used as a foundation to define more specific standards in this series.
