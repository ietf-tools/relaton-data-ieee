abstract:
- content: SystemVerilog 1800 is a Unified Hardware Design, Specification and Verification
    language. Verilog 1364-2005 is a design language. Both standards were approved
    by the IEEE-SASB in November 2005. This standard creates new revisions of the
    Verilog 1364 and SystemVerilog 1800 IEEE standards, which include Errata fixes
    and resolutions; enhancements; Enhanced assertion language; Merge of Verilog LRM
    and SystemVerilog 1800 LRM into a single LRM; Integration with AMS; and insures
    interoperability with other languages such as SystemC and VHDL.
