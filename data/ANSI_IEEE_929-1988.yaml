abstract:
- content: Superseded by 929-2000. Recommendations and requirements that ensure operation
    of the terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) system that is compatible with the electric
    utility are provided. Factors relating to personnel safety, equipment protection,
    and power quality are addressed. The standard applies to utility-interconnected
    residential and interm ediate-size PV power systems capable of two-way energy
    flow with the utility. It addresses the interface between the PV system and the
    utility, and provides technical recommendations for the characteristics of the
    interface. Power quality, equipment protection, and safety of personnel are covered.
