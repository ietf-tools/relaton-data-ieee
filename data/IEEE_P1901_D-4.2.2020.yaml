abstract:
- content: Physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers of a broadband powerline
    communication technology for local area networks (LANs), Smart Energy, Smart Grid,
    Internet of Things, transportation platforms (vehicle) applications, and other
    data distribution are defined in this standard. The balanced and efficient use
    of the power line communications channel by all classes of BPL devices is the
    main focus of this standard, defining detailed mechanisms for coexistence and
    interoperability between different BPL devices, and ensuring that desired bandwidth
    and quality of service may be delivered. The necessary security questions are
    addressed to ensure the privacy of communications between users and to allow the
    use of BPL for security sensitive services.
