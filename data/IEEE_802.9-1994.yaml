abstract:
- content: The scope of this IEEE standard is to develop an ISLAN (integrated services
    LAN) interface at the medium access control (MAC) sublayer and the Physical (PHY)
    layer compatible with IEEE 802.x and ISDN standards and architectures; develop
    an ISLAN interface that operates independently from the backbone network; focus
    upon unshielded twisted-pair wiring as the primary distribution medium; enable
    implementation of IS terminal equipment (ISTE) that accesses IEEE 802 LAN and
    ISDN services through a common interface
