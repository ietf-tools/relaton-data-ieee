abstract:
- content: This guide contains instructions for conducting tests to determine the
    performance characteristics of permanent magnet (PM) machines. The tests described
    may be applied to motors and generators, as needed, and no attempt is made to
    partition this guide into clauses applying to motors and clauses applying to generators.
    It is not intended that this guide shall cover all possible tests, or tests of
    a research nature, but only those general methods that may be used to obtain the
    performance data. The schedule of factory and field tests, which may be required
    on new equipment, is normally specified by applicable standards or by contract
    specifications. This guide should not be interpreted as requiring any specific
    test in a given transaction or implying any guarantee as to specific performance
    indices or operating conditions.
