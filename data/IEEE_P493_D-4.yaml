abstract:
- content: 'This project will present the fundamentals of reliability analysis that
    should be used in planning, designing and operating reliable industrial and commercial
    power systems. The reliability fundamentals would include: probability and computer
    based methodologies, power system and utility maintenance and equipment reliability
    data, cost of power interruptions, emergency and standby power, electrical preventive
    maintenance, 24 x 7 facilities, mission critical facilities, and methodologies
    for estimating the frequency of power and process interruptions caused by voltage
    sags based on facility equipment susceptibility characteristics and utility network
    feeder voltage sag characteristics.'
