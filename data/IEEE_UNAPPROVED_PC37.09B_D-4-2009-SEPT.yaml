abstract:
- content: This standard is revised to change the descriptions of the standard transient
    recovery voltage (TRV) envelope and ratings. This is applicable for ac high-voltage
    circuit breakers rated above 1000 V and on a symmetrical current basis. The capability
    limits of these circuit breakers are determined to a major degree by the TRV.
    The revised descriptions of TRV bring the TRV requirements in IEEE standards into
    harmony with the TRV requirements in IEC standards that apply to the same type
    and class of equipment. The TRV revisions addressed in this amendment to C37.09
    are described in amendment C37.04b-2008.
