abstract:
- content: Define structures in STIL for the specification of resource mapping of
    ATE hardware architectures. An example of resource mapping is the assignment of
    tester resources to waveform characters that are used in STIL-vectors. Define
    structures in STIL for including ATE specific instructions in-line with the STIL
    data. Define structures in STIL that allow for 'incremental processing' whereby,
    a set of STIL files may be targeted to mutliple ATE systems by allowing separately
    identified ATE data to co-exist. Define structures in STIL for defining tester
    rules checks to ensure that the set of generated STIL files conform to the selected
    resources on one or more ATE systems. Define structures in STIL for the specification
    of the resources required for the execution of a set of STIL files on a given
    ATE system.
