abstract:
- content: 'This Preprint provides the full text of each proposal to revise the 1997
    Edition of the NESC together with the recommendation of the subcommittee that
    has cognizance of the rule addresses by the change proposal (CP). A change bar,
    located in the left hand margin, signifies the specific material that the various
    subcommittees each have approved for inclusion in the revised Code. Two of the
    change proposals submitted apply to relatively large numbers of rules. For this
    reason, the Preprint is divided into two groups as follows: I. General. Change
    proposals that apply to a single rule or to a few closely related rules. This
    includes a proposal that is contained in an unnumbered section of the NESC (Letter
    Symbols for Units), and a proposal that affects three parts of the Code. II. Reorganization
    of Sections 25 and 26 on Loading and Strength of Overhead Lines. Contains CP 2372,
    which is a continuation of CP 1964 from the Preprint 1997 Proposals of the NESC.
    This CP consolidates similar requirements of similar Rules in Sections 25 and
    26.'
