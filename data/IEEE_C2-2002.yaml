abstract:
- content: This standard covers basic provisions for safeguarding of persons from
    hazards arising from the installation, operation, or maintenance of 1) conductors
    and equipment in electric supply stations, and 2) overhead and underground electric
    supply and communication lines. It also includes work rules for the construction,
    maintenance, and operation of electric supply and communication lines and equipment.
    The standard is applicable to the systems and equipment operated by utilities,
    or similar systems and equipment, of an industrial establishment or complex under
    the control of qualified persons. This standard consists of the introduction,
    definitions, grounding rules, list of referenced and bibliographic documents,
    and Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the 2002 Edition of the National Electrical Safety
    Code.
