abstract:
- content: Service conditions, electrical ratings, thermal ratings, electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC), and environmental testing requirements are defined in this
    standard based upon IEEE standards and five International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC) EMC standards (for which there are no equivalent IEEE standards), to represent
    the harsh environment of electric power apparatus installations. This develops
    a common and reproducible basis for designing and testing devices with communications
    functions installed in this harsh environment. Devices that support communications
    functions use communications ports. Where the device does not perform protection
    or control functions, testing of the communications functions is covered by IEEE
    Std 1613. Where the device performs protection or control functions and has communications
    ports, tests for all communications functions are covered by the IEEE C37.90 family
    of standards.
