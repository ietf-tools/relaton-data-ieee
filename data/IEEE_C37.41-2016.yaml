abstract:
- content: 'Required procedures for performing design tests for high-voltage fuses,
    as well as for fuse disconnecting switches, are specified. These design tests,
    as appropriate to a particular device, include the following test types: dielectric,
    interrupting, radio-influence, temperature-rise, time-current, manual-operation,
    liquid-tightness, thermal-cycle, bolt-torque, withstand tests for motor circuit
    fuses, expulsion fuses using polymeric insulators, load-break, and short-time
    current.'
