- content: ISO/IEC TR 24748-3:2011 is adopted by this standard..ISO/IEC TR 24748-3:2011
    is a guide for the application of ISO/IEC 12207:2008. It addresses system, life
    cycle, process, organizational, project, and adaptation concepts, principally
    through reference to ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC 12207:2008. It gives guidance
    on applying ISO/IEC 12207:2008 from the aspects of strategy, planning, application
    in organizations, and application on projects. ISO/IEC TR 24748-3:2011 is intentionally
    aligned with both ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC TR 24748-2 (Guide to the application
    of ISO/IEC 15288) in its terminology, structure and content.
