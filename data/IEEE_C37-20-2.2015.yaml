abstract:
- content: Metal-clad (MC) medium-voltage switchgear that contains drawout electrically
    operated circuit breakers is covered. MC switchgear is compartmentalized to isolate
    components such as instrumentation, main bus, and both incoming and outgoing connections
    with grounded metal barriers. Rated maximum voltage levels for metal-clad switchgear
    range from 4.76 kV to 38 kV with main bus continuous current ratings of 1200 A,
    2000 A, 3000 A, and 4000 A. MC switchgear also contains associated control, instruments,
    metering, relaying, protective, and regulating devices, as necessary. Service
    conditions, ratings, temperature limitations and classification of insulating
    materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures,
    and applications are discussed.
