abstract:
- content: This standard specifies requirements and specifications for using blockchain
    for green power identification applications. It describes a technical framework
    for the planning, design, construction and operation of green power identification
    systems. The purpose is to improve the efficiency of system interactions, perform
    life cycle traceability management of green power identification applications,
    enhance the efficiency of multi-subject identity authentication for green power
    identification, and thereby improve business efficiency.
