abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 1512.3-2006 This standard addresses the exchange
    of vital data about hazardous material and other cargo and contents of vehicles
    and buildings involved in transportation-related events, through common incident
    management message sets. That data exchange is specifically to support real-time
    interagency transportation-related incident management. Message sets specified
    are consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture
    and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) syntax. This standard
    comprises one companion volume of the family of incident management standards
    centered around a base standard:IEEE Std 1512-2000, IEEE Standard for Common Incident
    Management Message Sets for Use by Emergency Management Centers. Other members
    of that family that are forthcoming include two other companion volumes, specifying
    incident management message sets for transportation management and public safety.
    Collectively, this family of standards shall be referred to as the IEEE 1512 Family
    of Standards. The goal of these standards is to support efficient communication
    for the real-time, interagency management of transportation-related events. Those
    events include incidents, emergencies, accidents, planned roadway closures, special
    events, and disasters caused by humans or natural events. These events include
    any such event that impacts transportation systems, or that causes a report to
    be received by an emergency management system, whether or not the event actually
    affects a transportation system, and whether or not a response is required.
