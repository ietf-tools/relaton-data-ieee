abstract:
- content: This part of International Standard 62271 provides methods for the measurement
    of sound pressure level produced by outdoor alternating current circuit-breakers
    in a free-field environment. These methods may also be used indoors or in restricted
    field, provided that precautions are observed in the measurement and interpretation
    of the results.
