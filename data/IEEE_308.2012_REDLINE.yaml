abstract:
  content: Class 1E portions of ac and dc power systems and I&amp;C power systems
    in single-unit and multiunit nuclear power generating stations are covered in
    this standard. The provision of criteria for the determination of Class 1E power
    system design features, criteria for sharing Class 1E power systems in multiunit
    stations, the requirements for their testing and surveillance, and the requirements
    for documentation of the Class 1E power system is the intent of this standard.
