abstract:
- content: 'In this document, a standard is defined for setting up and operationalizing
    a data trading system (DTS) to trade data through a domain-independent and principled
    marketplace under a unified architecture. The document contains: definitions and
    specifications for stakeholders, relevant external entities, and objects; definitions
    of the reference model, trading terms, functional and non-functional requirements
    to operate a DTS; overview of the data trading via the DTS. These provides the
    foundation for operationalizing a data trading system that allows data trading
    among multi-stakeholders.'
