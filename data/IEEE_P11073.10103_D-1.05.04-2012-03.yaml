abstract:
- content: This project extends the base nomenclature provided in IEEE 11073 tosupport
    terminology for implantable cardiac devices. Devices within the scope of this
    nomenclature are implantable pacemakers, defibrillators, devices for cardiac resynchronization
    therapy, or cardiac monitors. This nomenclature defines the discrete terms necessary
    to convey a clinically relevant summary of the information obtained during a device
    interrogation.To improve workflow efficiencies cardiology and electrophysiology
    practices require the management of summary interrogation information from all
    vendor devices and systems in a central system such as an Electronic Health Record
    system or a device clinic management system. To address this requirement, the
    Implantable Device Cardiac (IDC) Nomenclature defines a standard-based terminology
    for device data. The nomenclature facilitates the transfer of data from the vendor
    proprietary systems to the clinic EHR or device clinic management system.
