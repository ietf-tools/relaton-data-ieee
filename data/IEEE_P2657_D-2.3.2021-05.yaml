abstract:
  content: 'In the DC electric railways, when a train regenerates power, usually the
    power has to be consumed within the DC network, because the DC Traction Power
    Systems are usually not reversible. There are several technologies to improve
    receptivity: energy consumption, energy feedback and energy storage. Solution
    selection depends on the application. The Energy Feedback Systems (EFSs) convert
    energy to AC power system as system DC voltage rises. Engineers are helped by
    this guide to decide where these EFSs can provide the greatest benefits, design
    solutions with the maximum effectiveness, and evaluate the costs and benefits
    of developing new EFS projects.'
