abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides calculation methods to conservatively
    evaluate the feasibility for an existing installed dry-type or liquid-filled transformer,
    to supply nonsinusoidal load currents as a portion of the total load. This recommended
    practice also provides necessary application information to assist in properly
    specifying a new transformer expected to carry a load, a portion of which is composed
    of nonsinusoidal load currents. A number of examples illustrating these methods
    and calculations are presented. Reference annexes provide a comparison of the
    document calculations to calculations found in other industry standards. Suggested
    temperature rise calculation methods are detailed for reference purposes.
