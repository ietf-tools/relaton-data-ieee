abstract:
- content: The purpose of this IEEE guide is to alert electric utilities, manufacturers
    of dispersed storage and generation (DSG) equipment, consultants, contractors
    and DSG owners and operators to the engineering concerns inherent in operating
    dispersed generators in parallel with utility systems; to describe proper interface
    construction techniques and operating procedures for those generators; to emphasise
    safety aspects involved; and to call attention to possible DSG impact on utility
    customers.<<ETX>>
