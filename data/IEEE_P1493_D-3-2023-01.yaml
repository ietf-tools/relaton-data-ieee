abstract:
- content: Test procedures for evaluating the physical characteristics of cable cleaning
    solvents and their compatibility with extruded dielectric cable components and
    cable accessories (joints and terminations) are provided in this guide. Compatibility
    is established by placing component samples in contact with the cleaning solvent
    for a short period and then measuring the physical or electrical properties of
    the component. The measured values are compared with values for samples that have
    not been in contact with the cleaner. Suggested performance values are provided.
    This guide also provides suggested procedures for evaluating the cleaning effectiveness
    of cable cleaning solvents. These comparative test procedures do not provide absolute
    performance values
