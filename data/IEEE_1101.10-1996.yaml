abstract:
- content: A generic standard that may be applied in all fields of electronics where
    equipment and installations are required to conform to the 482.6 mm (19 in) equipment
    practice based on IEEE Std 1101.1-1991, IEC 297-3 (1984), and IEC 297-4 (1995).
    Dimensions are provided that will ensure mechanical interchangeability of subracks
    and plug-in units.
