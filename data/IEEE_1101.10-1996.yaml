abstract:
- content: A generic standard that may be applied in all fields of electronics where
    equipment and installations are required to conform to the 482.6 mm (19 in) equipment
    practice based on IEEE 1101.1-1991, IEC 297-3 (1984), and IEC 297-4 (1995). Dimensions
    are provided that will ensure mechanical interchangeability of subracks and plug-in
    units.
