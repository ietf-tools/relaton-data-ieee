abstract:
- content: Approved Draft. This standard specifies the air interface, including the
    medium access control layer(MAC) and physical layer (PHY), of combined fixed and
    mobile point-to-multipoint broadbandwireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple
    services. The MAC is structured to supportthe WirelessMAN-SC, WirelessMAN-OFDM,
    and WirelessMAN-OFDMA PHY specifications,each suited to a particular operational
    environment. The standard enables rapid worldwidedeployment of innovative, cost-effective,
    and interoperable multivendor broadband wirelessaccess products, facilitates competition
    in broadband access by providing alternatives towireline broadband access, encourages
    consistent worldwide spectrum allocation, andaccelerates the commercialization
    of broadband wireless access systems.
