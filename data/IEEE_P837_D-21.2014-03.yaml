abstract:
  content: Direction and methods for qualifying permanent connections used for substation
    grounding are provided in this standard. This standard particularly addresses
    the connection used within the grid system, the connection used to join ground
    leads to the grid system, and the connection used to join the ground leads to
    equipment and structures.
