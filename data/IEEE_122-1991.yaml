abstract:
- content: 'Minimum functional and performance characteristics related to speed/load-control
    systems for steam turbine-generator units that may be interconnected on a power
    system are recommended. The recommendations apply to the following types of steam
    turbines, rated at 500 kW and larger, intended to drive electric generators at
    constant speed without initial steam-pressure control, exhaust steam-pressure
    control, or either: (1) condensing or noncondensing turbines without initial steam-pressure
    control, exhaust steam-pressure control, including turbines used with reheat,
    regenerative feedwater heaters, or both; (2) condensing or noncondensing turbines
    with initial and/or exhaust steam-pressure control, including turbines used with
    reheat, regenerative feedwater heaters, or both; (3) automatic extraction and/or
    induction and mixed-pressure turbines. Emergency governors, other overspeed control
    devices, and, in general, devices that are not responsive to speed, are not covered.'
