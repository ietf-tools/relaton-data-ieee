abstract:
- content: This standard describes test procedure, test point selection, test level,
    and acceptance criteria for repeatable electrostatic discharge immunity evaluations
    for tabletop and floor-standing protective relay equipment. Simulator characteristics
    for hand/metal ESD testing are specified for both the air and contact discharge
    methods. This standard has been harmonized with other ESD standards where consensus
    could be reached.
