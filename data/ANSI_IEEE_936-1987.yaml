abstract:
- content: This guide applies to self-commutated electronic power converters in which
    commutation is accomplished by components within the converter. In converters
    using switching devices that have turn-off capability, such as transistors or
    gate turn-off thyristors, interruption of the current results in a voltage that
    commutates the current to another branch. In converters using circuit-commutated
    thyristors, the commutating voltages required to transfer current from one branch
    to another are normally supplied by capacitors. The type of power conversion may
    be DC to AC, DC to DC, AC to DC, or AC to AC. Converters in which commutating
    voltages are supplied by the AC lines, the AC load, or some other AC source outside
    the converter, are excluded from the scope of this guide except where they may
    be linked with a self-commutated converter.<<ETX>>
