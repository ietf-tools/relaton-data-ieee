abstract:
- content: 'Dramatic success in machine learning has led to a new wave of artificial
    intelligence applications that offer extensive benefits to our daily lives. The
    loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability to
    vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and the
    general public -- all with a range of legal implications. The dilemma has called
    for the study of explainable AI (XAI) which is an active research field that aims
    to make AI systems results more understandable to humans. This is a field with
    great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is
    considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. This guide provides a technological
    blueprint for building, deploying and managing machine learning models while meeting
    the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI
    methodologies. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines
    for explainable AI, including: 1) description and definition of XAI, 2) the types
    of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies, 3) performance
    evaluation of XAI.'
