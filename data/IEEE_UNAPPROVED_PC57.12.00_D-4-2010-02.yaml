abstract:
- content: 'Electrical and mechanical requirements are set forth for liquid-immersed
    distribution and power transformers, and autotransformers and regulating transformers;
    single and polyphase, with voltages of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage
    winding. This standard is a basis for the establishment of performance, limited
    electrical and mechanical interchangeability requirements of equipment described;
    and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment. The requirements
    in this standard apply to all liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating
    transformers except the following: instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction
    voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty
    transformers, grounding transformers, mobile transformers, and mine transformers.'
