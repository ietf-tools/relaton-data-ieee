abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of the communication between personal strength
    fitness devices and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal
    health appliances, and set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability
    is established in this standard. Appropriate portions of existing standards including
    ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and information models are leveraged. The use of specific
    term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality
    in base frameworks in favor of interoperability is specified. A common core of
    communication functionality for personal telehealth strength fitness devices is
    defined. In this context, strength fitness devices are being used broadly to cover
    strength fitness devices that measure musculo-skeletal strength-conditioning activities.
