abstract:
- content: A uniform procedure for making corona (partial discharge) measurements
    by electrical means on electronic transformers is presented. Methods of applying
    voltage stress, the use of a sine-wave voltage to simulated dc and ac combinations,
    the types and limitations of voltage stresses encountered, and the acceptable
    limits of discharge pulse energy are included. Recommended test conditions and
    the need for negotiation of special tests are discussed. Test apparatus and calibration
    are described. The aim is to establish a common ground of understanding between
    transformer and systems design engineers and transformer manufacturers in the
    development of service and performance requirements.
