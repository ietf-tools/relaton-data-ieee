abstract:
- content: Recommendations for systems engineering, design, and integration of electrical
    power systems at the total ship level from concept design through the establishment
    of the design baseline prior to detail design are provided in this document. Recommendations
    for ac power systems, dc power systems, emergency power systems, shore power,
    quality of service, power quality and harmonics, electric propulsion and maneuvering
    systems, motors and drives, thrusters, and steering systems onboard ships are
    established by this document. These recommendations reflect the present-day technologies,
    engineering methods, and engineering practices. This document is intended to be
    used in conjunction with the IEEE 45(TM) series of documents.
