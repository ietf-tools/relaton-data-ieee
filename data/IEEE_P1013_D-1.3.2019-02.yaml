abstract:
- content: A method for determining the energy-capacity requirements (sizing) of both
    vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries used in terrestrial stand-alone
    photovoltaic (PV) systems is described in this recommended practice. Sizing batteries
    for hybrid or grid-connected PV systems is beyond the scope of this recommended
    practice. Installation, maintenance, safety, testing procedures, and consideration
    of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this recommended
    practice. Recommended practices for the remainder of the electrical systems associated
    with PV installations are also beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
