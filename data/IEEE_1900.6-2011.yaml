abstract:
- content: The interfaces and data structures required to exchange sensing-related
    information in order to increase interoperability between sensors and their clients
    developed by different manufacturers are defined in this standard. The logical
    interface and supporting data structures are defined abstractly without constraining
    the sensing technology, client design, or data link between sensor and client.
    The entities involved and parameters exchanged in this process. It further elaborates
    on the service access points, service primitives, as well as generic procedures
    used to realize this information exchange, are defined by this standard.
