abstract:
- content: 'This standard represents a merger of two previous standards: IEEE 1364-2005
    Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and IEEE 1800-2005 SystemVerilog unified
    hardware design, specification and verification language. The 2005 SystemVerilog
    standard defines extensions to the 2005 Verilog standard. These two standards
    were designed to be used as one language. Merging the base Verilog language and
    the SystemVerilog extensions into a single standard enables users to have all
    information regarding syntax and semantics in a single document.'
