abstract:
- content: 'This publication has been prepared to provide all interested persons an
    opportunity to study and comment on the Proposed Revisions to be incorporated
    into the 2012 Edition of the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC<sup>reg</sup>).
    This Preprint provides the full text of each proposal to revise the 2007 Edition
    of the NESC together with the recommendation of the subcommittee that has cognizance
    of the rule addressed by the change proposal (CP). The deadline for receipt of
    comments on the Proposal Revision contained herein is 1 May 2010. All comments
    shall be submitted through the Web site shown below. Only comments that are submitted
    electronically through the Web site will be accepted. (http://standards.ieee.org/nesc/Iumldagger/welcome.html)
    Comments for each separate topic are to be uploaded separately using the template
    at the following URL: (http://standards.ieee. org/nesc/rp/Comment.doc). In those
    cases where a single CP or a group of related CPs affects rules within the scopes
    of two or more subcommittees, the recommendation of all subcommittees affected
    are included. Where the recommendation of two or more subcommittees are not compatible
    with each other, a recommendation by Subcommittee 1, which is responsible for
    coordination, is also included. Please note that the subcommittee recommendations
    herein are subject to further review and revision by the cognizant subcommittee
    following study and evaluation of all comments received. The subcommittee final
    recommendation will be prepared for a January 2011 letter ballot of the National
    Electrical Safety Code Committee. It is anticipated that the approved text will
    be submitted for American National Standards Institute approval in May 2011, with
    publication of the NESC 2012 Edition on 1 August 2011.'
