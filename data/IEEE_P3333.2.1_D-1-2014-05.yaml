abstract:
- content: This standard describes the generation and practical use of medical three-dimensional
    (3D) modeling for diagnostics and therapeutic applications. It includes volume
    rendering and surface rendering techniques for 3D reconstruction from two-dimensional
    (2D) medical images and a texturing method of 3D medical data for realistic visualization.
