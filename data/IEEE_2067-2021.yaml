abstract:
- content: The purpose of this standard is to clarify definitions so that ambiguity
    in specifications can be eliminated to facilitate broad usage of Fiber Optic Bragg
    grating sensors in a broad range of applications including smart civil structures,
    avionics, security, defense, environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics.
    Definitions and explanations of terms relating to the use of fiber Bragg grating
    interrogators are provided in this standard. It also offers a list of the key
    performance parameters needed to describe fully a Bragg grating-based sensor system
    and to allow the end user readily to compare systems from different suppliers
    for specific applications.
