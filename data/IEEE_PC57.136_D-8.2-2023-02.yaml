abstract:
- content: Information on sources of no-load and load sound in liquid-immersed power
    transformers is provided in this guide. Industry standards that deal with transformer
    sound and factors affecting sound levels of transformers in field operation are
    also discussed. Guidelines are provided for the selection of suitable methods
    of reduction of transformer sound at the design stage, during manufacturing, and
    on site. Procedures that are typically used for determining required sound levels
    of power transformers on site are described. The intent is to provide users and
    manufacturers with sufficient background that can help produce power transformers
    that meet limits on sound level required by local sound ordinances.
