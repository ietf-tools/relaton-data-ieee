abstract:
- content: The components of a fingerprint test system for smart devices, such as
    a mobile phone are specified in this standard. Test system requirements are specified
    together with criteria for performance evaluation, testing methods and procedures
    and result reporting. Performance metrics which reflect expected device usage
    are specified, including false accept rate and false reject rate. Multiple testing
    levels are defined to support a variety of device types.
