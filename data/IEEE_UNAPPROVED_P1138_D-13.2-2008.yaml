abstract:
- content: This standard covers the performance, test requirements, procedures and
    acceptance criteria for a transmission line overhead ground wire (a.k.a. shield
    wire, static wire, earth wire, skywire) with optical fibers commonly known as
    Optical Ground Wire (OPGW). An OPGW cable has the dual performance functions of
    a ground wire with telecommunications capabilities. This standard includes functional
    requirements such as electrical, mechanical, optical fiber, environmental and
    packaging; test requirements related to design, installation, in-service, maintenance,
    including routine tests. This standard is not intended to supersede any established
    safety rules, codes, regulations, or practices associated with the use of OPGW
    cables. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate
    safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations
    prior to use.
