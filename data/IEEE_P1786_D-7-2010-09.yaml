abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance for the application of Computerized Operating
    Procedure Systems (COPS). This guidance concerns the design (i.e., form and function)
    and use of COPS. In general, this guide does not concern itself with the technical
    content of the operating procedures being presented except as needed to address
    unique aspects of procedure implementation on COPS. Software tools that can be
    described as computerized procedures but are implemented outside the control room
    (such as might be used for maintenance or testing) are also beyond the scope of
    this document.
