abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the 802 family on LAN/MAN. Port-based
    network access control makes use of the physical access characteristics of IEEE
    802 Local Area Networks (LAN) infrastructures in order to provide a means of authenticating
    and authorizing devices attached to a LAN port that has point-to-point connection
    characteristics, and of preventing access to that port in cases in which the authentication
    and authorization process fails.
