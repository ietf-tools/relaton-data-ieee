abstract:
- content: This standard establishes a normative definition of communication between
    personal telehealth International Normalized Ratio (INR) devices (agents) and
    managers (e.g. cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set
    top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages
    work done in other ISO/IEEE 11073 standards including existing terminology, information
    profiles, application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies
    the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments
    restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This
    standard defines a common core of functionality of personal International Normalized
    Ratio (INR) physical activity monitors. In the context of personal health devices,
    INR monitoring refers to the measurement of the Prothrombin Time (PT) that is
    used to assess the level of anti-coagulant therapy and its presentation as the
    International Normalized Ratio compared to the Prothrombin Time of normal blood
    plasma. Applications of the INR monitor include the management of the therapeutic
    level of anti-coagulant used in the treatment of a variety of conditions. This
    standard provides the data modeling and its transport shim layer according to
    the IEEE Std 11073-16 20601 ISO/IEEE 11073-20601-201011073-20601a-2010 standard,
    and does not specify the measurement method.
