abstract:
- content: This guide outlines the design of protection systems for Dynamic Reactive
    Power Compensators (DRPC). The guide covers protection schemes and philosophies,
    instrument transformers, relay protection, control system protection, and testing
    related to the DRPC application. Differences between conventional substation and
    DRPC protection is discussed, including protection schemes and functions. Recommendations
    are provided for substation buses, power transformers, and associated branches
    such as Voltage Sourced Converters (VSC), Thyristor Switched Capacitors (TSC),
    Thyristor Switched Reactor (TSR), Thyristor Controlled Reactors (TCR), harmonic
    filter banks, grounding transformers, and auxiliary transformers, as well as power
    electronic valves and associated cooling systems. Finally, the guide discusses
    considerations for testing of DRPC control and protection systems.
