abstract:
- content: Background on light flicker caused by fluctuations in power demands of
    variable loads is presented in this recommended practice. A flicker measurement
    method is presented using a meter that is completely described in IEC 61000-4-15.
    The short-term (Pst) and long-term (Plt) flicker indices used for the analysis
    of flicker data are defined. Flicker limits for various voltage levels are presented.
    An assessment procedure for evaluating flicker compliance against emission limits
    is described. Methodologies to analyze background flicker to identify the flicker
    contribution of single loads are also presented.
