abstract:
- content: The design of automatic train protection and signal systems for rail transit
    systems requires knowledge of the braking distance of the vehicles utilized on
    the systems. This guide provides methods and assumptions used in calculating the
    braking distances of rail transit vehicles. The methods encompass automatic train
    protection and signal system operation, propulsion and brake system operation,
    environmental conditions, operator interfaces, tolerances, and failure modes.
