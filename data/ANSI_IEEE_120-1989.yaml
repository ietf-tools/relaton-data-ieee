abstract:
- content: Instructions are given for measuring electrical quantities that are commonly
    needed to determine the performance characteristics of electric machinery and
    equipment. Methods are given for measuring voltage, current, power, energy, power
    factor, frequency, impedance, and magnetic quantities, with either analog or digital
    indicating or integrating instruments, in DC or AC rotating machines, transformers,
    induction apparatus, arc and resistance heating equipment, mercury arc, theremionic,
    or solid-state rectifiers and inverters. Ancillary instruments and equipment are
    discussed. Computer-based techniques and the use of optical fibers in instrumentation
    are considered.
