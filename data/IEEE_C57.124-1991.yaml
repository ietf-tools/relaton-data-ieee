abstract:
- content: IEEE Std C57.124-1991 covers the detection of partial discharges occurring
    in the insulation of dry-type transformers of their components and the measurement
    of the associated apparent charge at the terminals when alternating test voltage
    is applied. The wideband method is used. The detection system and calibrator characteristics
    are described, and the test procedure is established.
