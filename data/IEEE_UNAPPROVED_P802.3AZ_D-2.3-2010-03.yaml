abstract:
- content: '"This draft is an amendment of IEEE Std 802.3-2008 and includes a new
    clause, Clause 78, which provides an overview of changes required to enable energy
    efficient operation of several existing physical layers. Changes to the specifications
    of these physical layers are also included in this draft. Draft D2.3 is prepared
    by the IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Task Force as the third recirculation draft
    for working group ballot. This draft reflects changes made in response to the
    comment resolutions and motions from the task force Plenary meeting held the week
    of January 25, 2010 and expires 6 months after the date of publication or when
    the next version is published, whichever comes first."'
