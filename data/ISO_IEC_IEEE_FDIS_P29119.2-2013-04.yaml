abstract:
- content: This part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 specifies test processes that can be used
    to govern, manage and implement software testing for any organization, project
    or smaller testing activity. It comprises generic test process descriptions that
    define the software testing processes. Supporting informative diagrams describing
    the processes are also provided. This part of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 is applicable
    to testing in all software development lifecycle models. This part of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29119 is intended for, but not limited to, testers, test managers, developers
    and project managers, particularly those responsible for governing, managing and
    implementing software testing.
