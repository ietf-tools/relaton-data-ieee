abstract:
- content: Data interchange and standard software services for test and diagnostic
    environmentsare defined by Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to
    All Test Environments (AIESTATE).The purpose of AI-ESTATE is to standardize interfaces
    for functional elements of anintelligent diagnostic reasoner and representations
    of diagnostic knowledge and data for use bysuch diagnostic reasoners. Formal information
    models are defined to form the basis for a formatto facilitate exchange of persistent
    diagnostic information between two reasoners and also toprovide a formal typing
    system for diagnostic services. The services to control a diagnosticreasoned are
    defined by this standard.
