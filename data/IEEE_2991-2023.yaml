abstract:
- content: General technical specifications for live-working robots on 6 kV to 35
    kV distribution lines are provided in this guide. Compositions and categorizations
    are introduced. General technical requirements of insulation, electromagnetic
    compatibility, mechanical properties, control system, and safety are presented.
    In addition, reference methods for testing the performances of the robot are recommended.
