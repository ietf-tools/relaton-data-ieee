- content: Revision of IEEE Std C37.40-1993 and C37.40b-1996. Superseded by IEEE C37.41-2016.
    Service conditions and definitions for high-voltage fuses (above 1000 V), distribution
    enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories
    for ac distribution systems are covered. These include enclosed, open, and open-link
    types of distribution cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting fuses;
    distribution enclosed single-pole air switches; power fuses, including current-limiting
    types; outdoor and indoor fuse disconnecting switches; fuse supports, mountings,
    switch sticks, and links, all of the type used exclusively with the above; and
    removable switch blades for certain products among the above.
