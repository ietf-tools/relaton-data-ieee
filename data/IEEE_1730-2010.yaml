abstract:
- content: Recommended practice for Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution
    Process (DSEEP) is described. The DSEEP is intended as a high-level process framework
    into which the lower-level systems engineering practices native to any distributed
    simulation user can be easily integrated. Simulation architectures include Distributed
    Interactive Simulation (DIS), High Level Architecture (HLA), and Test and Training
    Enabling Architecture (TENA).
