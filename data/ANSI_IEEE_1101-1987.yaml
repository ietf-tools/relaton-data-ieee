abstract:
- content: 'The standard covers three areas: the basic dimensions of subracks, this
    range of modular subracks conforming to IEC 297-3-1984, for mounting in equipment
    according to IEC 297-1-1986, and ANSI/EIA RS-310, together with the basic dimensions
    of a compatible range of plug-in units, printed boards, and backplanes; the dimensions
    of plug-in units and connectors, this standard gives the dimensions of associated
    plug-in units and connectors standardized by IEC 603-2-1980, together with applicable
    detail dimensions of the subrack; and the environmental requirements of subracks,
    this standard states environmental requirements of subracks and their associated
    plug-in units. The purpose of the standard is the specification of dimensions
    that will ensure the mechanical interchangeability and environmental requirements
    of subracks and of plug-in units.'
