abstract:
- content: Varistors for surge-protective applications on systems with dc to 420 Hz
    frequency and voltages equal to or less than 1000 V rms, or 1200 V dc, are covered.
    Definitions, service conditions, and a series of test criteria for determining
    the electrical characteristics of the varistors are provided. The tests are intended
    as design tests and provide a means of comparing various surge-protective devices.
