abstract:
- content: 'This standard defines elements and commonly used components in excitation
    control systems and contains definitions for excitation systems as applied to
    synchronous machines. These definitions should be useful in the following areas:
    -- Writing excitation systems specifications -- Evaluating excitation system performance
    -- Specifying methods for excitation system tests -- Preparing related excitation
    system standards -- Serving as an educational means for those becoming acquainted
    with excitation systems -- Modeling excitation systems'
