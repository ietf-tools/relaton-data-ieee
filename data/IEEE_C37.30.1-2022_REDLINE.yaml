abstract:
- content: Required ratings, construction requirements, design test requirements,
    applications, and suggested practices for all high-voltage enclosed indoor and
    outdoor and non-enclosed indoor and outdoor switches rated above 1000 V are specified.
    This includes ratings and requirements for such switches as disconnecting, selector,
    horn-gap, grounding, etc., for manual and power operation, except for interrupter
    switches, distribution-enclosed single-pole air switches, and distribution cutouts
    fitted with disconnecting blades.
