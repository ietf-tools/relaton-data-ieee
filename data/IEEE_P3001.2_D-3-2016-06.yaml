abstract:
- content: This standard explores commercial, institutional, a 1 nd industrial design
    of electrical services, interconnecting with a utility distribution or transmission
    system. This standard considers the electrical system information needed by the
    designer concerning the utility’s system characteristics and the electrical load
    information need by the utility to design a satisfactory electrical interface
    between the serving utility and the premise electrical distribution system
