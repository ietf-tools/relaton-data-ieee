abstract:
- content: Circuitry that may be built into an integrated circuit to assist in the
    test, maintenance and support of assembled printed circuit boards, assembled multi-die
    packages and the test of die internal circuits is defined. The circuitry includes
    a packet decoder and standard architecture through which instructions and test
    data are communicated. The standard leverages the languages of IEEE Std. 1149.1
    in order to describe and operate the onchip circuits.
