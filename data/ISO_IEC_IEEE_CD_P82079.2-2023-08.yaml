abstract:
- content: This document applies to the preparation of instructions for assembly of
    self-assembly products. It provides requirements and recommendations for the presentation
    of instructions to a non-skilled target audience assembling a product without
    help from a trainer or supervisor. These requirements and recommendations are
    additional to those in IEC/IEEE 82079-1, which applies to the preparation of all
    information for use of all products including aspects such as operation and maintenance.
