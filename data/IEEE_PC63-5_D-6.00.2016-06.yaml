  content: Methods for determining antenna factors of antennas used for radiated emission
    measurements in electromagnetic interference (EMI) control from 9 kHz to 40 GHz
    are provided. Antennas included are linearly-polarized antennas such as loops,
    rods (monopoles), tuned dipoles, biconical dipoles, log-periodic dipole arrays,
    biconical and log-periodic dipole array hybrids, broadband horns, etc., which
    are used in measurements prescribed by ANSI C63.4 and ANSI C63.10. The antenna
    calibration methods include standard site method (i.e., three-antenna method),
    reference antenna method, equivalent capacitance substitution method, standard
    transmit loop method, standard antenna method, and standard field method.
