abstract:
- content: This document provides alternative approaches and good practices for the
    design, operation, and integration of distributed resource (DR) island systems
    with electric power systems (EPS). This includes the ability to separate from
    and reconnect to part of the area EPS while providing power to the islanded EPSs.
    This guide includes the distributed resources, interconnection systems, and participating
    electric power systems.
