abstract:
- content: The minimum performance criteria for active interrogation systems in homeland
    security applications are described in this standard. These systems are intended
    for non-intrusive inspection of closed containers, vehicles, and packages of a
    wide range of types and sizes. In these systems, the contents of an inspection
    zone are irradiated with penetrating ionizing radiation to determine the presence
    of a hidden substance-of-interest by the analysis of stimulated secondary radiations
    or absorption spectra that are indicative of the elemental and/or isotopic composition
    of the substances-of-interest (special nuclear material, explosives, chemical
    warfare agents). The "IEEE Get Program" grants public access to view and download
    individual PDFs of select standards at no charge. Visit https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page
    for details.
