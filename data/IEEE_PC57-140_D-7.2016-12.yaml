abstract:
- content: 'Guidelines for the following are included in the standard: insulating
    liquid maintenance and diagnostics, liquid reclamation, testing methods for the
    determination of remaining insulation (paper) life, and upgrades of auxiliary
    equipment such as bushings, gauges, de-energized tap changers (DETCs), load tap
    changers (LTCs) (where applicable), and coil re-clamping. The goal of this guide
    is to assist the user in extending the useful life of a transformer.'
