abstract:
- content: This recommended practice covers reliability planning and design of industrial
    and commercial power systems. It is likely to be of greatest value to the power-oriented
    engineer with limited experience in the area of reliability. It can also be an
    aid to all engineers responsible for the electrical design of industrial and commercial
    power systems.
