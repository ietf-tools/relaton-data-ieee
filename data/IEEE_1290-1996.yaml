abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed September 22, 2005 Motors used to drive valve operators in nuclear
    power generating stations are discussed. Guidelines to evaluate the adequacy of
    motors used to drive valve operators; to provide recommendations for motor application;
    and to provide methods for protection, control, and testing of motors used for
    valve operation are presented.
