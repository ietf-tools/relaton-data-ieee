abstract:
- content: 'The required elements for developing, implementing, and administering
    effective electromagnetic energy (EME) safety programs (SPs) to achieve compliance
    with applicable human exposure limits are specified. Concomitant EME hazards,
    such as those caused by interference to medical devices, ignition of flammable
    atmospheres, and detonation of explosive devices, are also addressed. Well-established
    safety processes are used to manage potential EME hazards from known EME sources
    in the 0 Hz to 300 GHz frequency range. SP elements for identifying EME hazard
    locations, implementing needed controls, and training personnel, are included.
    Additional descriptions and examples of the SP elements and various factors that
    can be helpful when assessing potential hazards and creating SPs are annexed.
