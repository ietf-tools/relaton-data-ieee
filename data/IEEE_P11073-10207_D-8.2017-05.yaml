abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073(TM) family of standards for point-of-care
    medical device communication, a Participant Model derived from the ISO/IEEE11073-10201
    Domain Information Model is provided in this standard. The Participant Model specifies
    the structure of medical information objects. This standard also defines an abstract
    Communication Model to support the exchange of medical information objects. All
    elements of the Participant Model and Communication Model are specified using
    XML Schema. Core subjects of the Participant Model comprise modelling of medical
    device-related data, e.g., measurements and settings, alert systems, contextual
    information (e.g., patient demographics and location information), remote control,
    and archival information. Model extensibility is provided inherently through the
    use of XML Schema.textual information like patient demographics and location information,
    remote control, and archival. Model extensibility is provided inherently through
    the use of XML Schema. (Additional files are available for this standard at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/11073/)
