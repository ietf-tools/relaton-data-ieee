abstract:
- content: Proper maintenance will prolong the life of a battery and will aid in assuring
    that it is capable of supplying its design power requirements. A good battery
    maintenance program will serve as a valuable aid in determining the need for battery
    replacement. Station battery maintenance should be performed by personnel knowledgeable
    of batteries and the safety precautions involved.
