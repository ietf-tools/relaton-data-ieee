abstract:
- content: This guide discusses and recommends methods of testing and evaluating dissolved
    gases in mineral based transformer oils found in Load Tap Changers (LTCs). General
    types of LTC mechanisms, breathing configurations and electrical design will be
    included as evaluation criteria in determining when mechanical damage or failure
    has occurred. Dissolved Gas of the LTC is required. This guide will not be manufacturer
    specific, rather category specific.
