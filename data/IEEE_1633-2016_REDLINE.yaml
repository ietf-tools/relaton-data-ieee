abstract:
- content: The methods for assessing and predicting the reliability of software, based
    on a life-cycle approach to software reliability engineering (SRE), are prescribed
    in this recommended practice. It provides information necessary for the application
    of software reliability (SR) measurement to a project, lays a foundation for building
    consistent methods, and establishes the basic principle for collecting the data
    needed to assess and predict the reliability of software. The recommended practice
    prescribes how any user can participate in SR assessments and predictions.
