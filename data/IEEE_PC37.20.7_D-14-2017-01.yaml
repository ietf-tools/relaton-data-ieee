abstract:
- content: A procedure for testing and evaluating the performance of switchgear for
    internal arcing faults is covered. A method of identifying the capabilities of
    this equipment is given. Service conditions, installation, and application of
    equipment are also discussed. As used in this document, the term "switchgear"
    is used as a general term covering switching and interrupting devices and their
    combination with associated control, instrumentation, metering, protective and
    regulating devices, assemblies of those devices with associated interconnections,
    accessories, and supporting structures used primarily in conjunction with the
    generation, transmission, distribution, and conversion of electrical power.
