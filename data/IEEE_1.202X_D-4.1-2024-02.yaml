abstract:
- content: 'POSIX.1-202x defines a standard operating system interface and environment,
    including a command interpreter (or "shell"), and common utility programs to support
    applications portability at the source code level. POSIX.1-202x is intended to
    be used by both application developers and system implementors and comprises four
    major components (each in an associated volume): &#8226; General terms, concepts,
    and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including utility conventions
    and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume.
    &#8226; Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific
    system services for the C programming language, function issues, including portability,
    error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume.
    &#8226; Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation
    services (a "shell") and common utility programs for application programs are
    included in the Shell and Utilities volume. &#8226; Extended rationale that did
    not fit well into the rest of the document structure, which contains historical
    information concerning the contents of POSIX.1-202x and why features were included
    or discarded by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative)
    volume. The following areas are outside the scope of POSIX.1-202x: &#8226; Graphics
    interfaces &#8226; Database management system interfaces &#8226; Record I/O considerations
    &#8226; Object or binary code portability &#8226; System configuration and resource
    availability POSIX.1-202x describes the external characteristics and facilities
    that are of importance to application developers, rather than the internal construction
    techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed
    on those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial
    applications.'
