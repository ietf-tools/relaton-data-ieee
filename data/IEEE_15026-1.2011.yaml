abstract:
- content: This trial-use standard adopts ISO/IEC TR 15026-1:2010, which defines terms
    and establishes an extensive and organized set of concepts and their relationships
    for software and systems assurance, thereby establishing a basis for shared understanding
    of the concepts and principles central to ISO/I EC 15026 across its user communities.
    It provides information to users of the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 15026, including
    the use of each part and the combined use of multiple parts. Coverage of assurance
    for a service being operated and managed on an ongoing basis is not covered in
    ISO/I EC 15026.
