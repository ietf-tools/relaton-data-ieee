abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standars product is part of the Color Books family. The design
    of reliable industrial and commercial power distribution systems is important
    because of the high cost associated with power outages and their significant impact
    on society. It is necessary to consider the cost of power outages when making
    decisions for new power distribution systems. It is also necessary to have the
    ability to make quantitative “cost-versus-reliability” trade-off studies. The
    IEEE Gold Book provides credible data concerning equipment reliability and the
    cost of power outages so that these trade-off studies can be conducted. The purpose
    of the IEEE Gold Book is to provide sufficient information so that reliability
    analysis can be performed on power systems without requiring cross-references
    to other texts. Information included in the book is the result of extensive surveys
    of reliability of electrical equipment in industrial plants and the costs of power
    outages for both industrial plants and commercial buildings. The reliability surveys
    provide historical experience to those who are not able to collect their own data.
    The IEEE Gold Book covers many aspects of reliability analysis. The basic concepts
    of reliability analysis by probability methods, fundamentals of power system reliability
    evaluation, the economic evaluation of reliability, and cost of power outage data
    are included in the book. Reliability data, as well as electrical preventive maintenance
    for different types of equipment, are provided. Some concepts of emergency and
    standby power, such as reliability compliance testing, are also included in the
    IEEE Gold Book. The book also focuses on the improvement and evaluation of reliability
    in existing facilities. Voltage sags, and a methodology for estimating the frequency
    of these sags, are also discussed.
