abstract:
- content: 'Detailed procedures for analyzing gas from gas spaces or gas-collecting
    devices as well as gas dissolved in oil are described for use in power transformers.
    The procedures cover: (1) the calibration and use of field instruments for detecting
    and estimating the amount of combustible gases present in gas blankets above oil,
    or in gas detector relays; (2) the use of fixed instruments for detecting an determining
    the quantity of combustible gases present in gas-blanketed equipment; (3) obtaining
    samples of gas and oil from the transformer for laboratory analysis; (4) laboratory
    methods for analyzing the gas blanket and the gases extracted from the oil; and
    (5) interpreting the results in terms of transformer serviceability. The intent
    is to provide the operator with positive and useful information concerning the
    serviceability of the equipment. An extensive bibliography on gas evolution, detection,
    and interpretation is included.<<ETX>>'
