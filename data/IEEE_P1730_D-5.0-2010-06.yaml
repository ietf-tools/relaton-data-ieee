abstract:
- content: This document describes the Recommended Practice for Distributed Simulation
    Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP). The DSEEP is intended as a high-level
    process framework into which the lower-level systems engineering practices native
    to any distributed simulation user can, such as DIS, HLA and TENA, be easily integrated.
