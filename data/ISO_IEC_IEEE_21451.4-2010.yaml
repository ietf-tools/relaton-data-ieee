abstract:
- content: This standard defines the protocol and interface that allows analog transducers
    to communicate digital information with an IEEE 1451 object. It also defines the
    format of the Transducer TEDS. The Transducer TEDS is based on the IEEE 1451.2&#x2122;
    TEDS. The standard does not specify the transducer design, signal conditioning,
    or the specific use of the TEDS.
