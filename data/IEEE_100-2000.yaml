abstract:
- content: The terms defined in the Dictionary are listed in letter-by-letter alphabetical
    order. Spaces are ignored in this style of alphabetization, so cable value will
    come before cab signal. Descriptive categories associated with the term in earlier
    editions of the Dictionary will follow the term in parentheses. New categories
    appear after the definitions (see Categories, below), followed by the designation
    of the standard or standards that include the definition. If a standard designation
    is followed by the letter s, it means that edition of the standard was superseded
    by a newer revision and the term was not included in the revision. If a designation
    is followed by the letter w, it means that edition of the standard was withdrawn
    and not replaced by a revision. A bracketed number refers to the non-IEEE standard
    sources given in the back of the book.Abstracts of the current set of approved
    IEEE standards are provided in the back of the book. It should be noted that updated
    information about IEEE standards can be obtained at any time from the IEEE Standards
    World Wide Web site at http://standards.ieee.org/.
