abstract:
- content: 'IEEE Std P1920.1TM defines air-to-air communications for self-organized
    ad hoc aerial networks. It outlines the network service architecture, security
    framework, and data model. IEEE Std P1920.1 is agnostic to the type of network
    (Wireless or Cellular or other) and it is applicable to crewed and uncrewed, small
    and large, and civil and commercial aircraft systems. IEEE Std P1920.1 is the
    first in the series of IEEE P1920.X standards. It is anticipated that IEEE Std
    P1920.1 will be used as a foundation to define more specific standards in this
    series. For example, the development of IEEE Std P1920.2: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications
    is currently taking place. This document contains seven clauses. The first three
    clauses provide an introduction and important information about IEEE Std P1920.1.
    The fourth clause presents an overview of aerial ad hoc networks. The fifth clause
    addresses network architecture, and the sixth clause addresses security architecture.
    The seventh clause outlines the data model with a set typical use cases.'
