abstract:
- content: The encapsulation and mapping of radio protocols for transport over Ethernet
    frames, using radio over Ethernet (RoE), are defined in this standard. Structure-agnostic
    definitions are provided for any digitized radio data. Structure-aware definitions
    are provided for the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI(TM)). Native mode definitions
    are provided for digitized radio in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) payload.
