abstract:
- content: Effective regulation of civil unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a key factor
    to ensure the implementation of the low-altitude opening policy and promote the
    development of the Drone industry and low-altitude economy. The current UAV flight
    supervision technology based on cloud system relies on mobile public networks
    that have many blind spots and UAV ground measurement and control links that are
    easily interrupted by terrain and other factors, affecting the continuity of UAV
    flight supervision. Message transmission through GNSS short message 6 mechanism
    are not restricted by space, territory and terrain, which can enhance the continuity
    and stability of transmission for UAV flight supervision and is an effective supplement
    of the existing technique. This document specifies the content, the transmission
    protocol, and the transmission method of UAV flight supervision data based on
    GNSS short message mechanism.
