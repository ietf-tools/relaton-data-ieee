abstract:
- content: This recommended practice establishes methods of quality assessment of
    light field imaging based on psycho-physical studies. It also defines metrics
    for the quality assessment and establishes criteria for subjective assessment
    of light field imaging, including human factors and judgments, and identifies
    and quantifies quality degradation including the impact of visual contents, camera
    settings, compression distortion, interpolation distortion by intermediate view
    rendering, and structural distortion. The recommended practice addresses a series
    of visual phenomena that can degrade visualization specifically for light field
    imaging. Visual environment characteristics and viewing conditions are also part
    of the scope of the standard, including viewing distance, viewer position, viewing
    freedom, and display characteristics.
