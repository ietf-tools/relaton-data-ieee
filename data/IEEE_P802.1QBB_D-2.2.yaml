abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies protocols, procedures and managed objects that
    enable flowcontrol per traffic class on IEEE 802 point-to-point full duplex links.
    This is achieved by amechanism similar to the IEEE 802.3 Annex 31B PAUSE, but
    operating on individual priorities.
