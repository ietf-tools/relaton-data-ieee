abstract:
- content: The definition and application of function numbers for devices used in
    electrical substations and generating plants and in installations of power utilization
    and conversion apparatus are covered. The purpose of the numbers is discussed,
    and 94 numbers are assigned. The use of prefixes and suffixes to provide a more
    specific definition of the function is considered. Device contact designation
    is also covered.
