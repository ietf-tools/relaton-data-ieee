abstract:
- content: This standard is part of a family of local area network (LAN) standards
    dealing with the physical and data link layers as defined by the ISO Open Systems
    Interconnection Reference Model. It describes the functions, features, protocol,
    and services of the logical link control (LLC) sublayer, which constitutes the
    top sublayer in the data link layer of the ISO 8802 Local Area Network Protocol.
    The services required of, or by, the LLC sublayer at the logical interfaces with
    the network layer, the MAC sublayer, and the LLC sublayer management function
    are specified. The protocol data unit (PDU) structure for data communication systems
    is defined using bit-oriented procedures, as are two types of operation for data
    communication between service access points. In one type of operation, PDUs are
    exchanged between LLCs without the need for the establishment of a data link connection.
    In the other, a data link connection is established between two LLCs prior to
    any exchange of information-bearing PDUs.
