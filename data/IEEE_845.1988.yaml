abstract:
- content: Superseded. This guide provides a basis for the systematic evaluation of
    man- machine performance in nuclear power generating station control rooms and
    other peripheries, as such performance relates to nuclear plant safety. Basic
    information is supplied as to the available human factors techniques and their
    applicability to the various human-related issues confronting the commercial nuclear
    industry today. A brief review is provided of selected, commonly used techniques,
    along with guidance as to their use and where further related information can
    be obtained.
