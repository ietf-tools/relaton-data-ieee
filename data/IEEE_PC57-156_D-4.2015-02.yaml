abstract:
- content: 'This guide describes measures that may be taken to help mitigate tank
    rupture of energized liquid-immersed power transformers and reactors due to internal
    electrical faults. This guide does not cover the release of oil or oil mist due
    to failure of the following components: load tap changer compartments, bushings
    and their turrets, conservator tank, piping, valves, pumps and radiators.'
