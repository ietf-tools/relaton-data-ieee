abstract:
- content: This standard defines a set of tools for efficient video coding, including
    directional intraprediction, variable block size inter prediction and context
    adaptive binary arithmetic coding and the corresponding decoding procedure. The
    target applications and services include but not limited TV over Internet, User
    Generated Multimedia Content, IP-based video conference, IP-based surveillance
    and other video/audio enabled services and applications such as digital television
    broadcasting, digital storage media, and communication.
