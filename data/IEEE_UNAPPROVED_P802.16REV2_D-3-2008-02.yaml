abstract:
- content: layer (PHY), of combined fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint broadband
    wireless access (BWA) systems providing multiple services. The MAC is structured
    to support multiple physical layer (PHY) specifications, each suited to a particular
    operational environment. The standard enables rapid worldwide deployment of innovative,
    cost effective, and interoperable multivendor broadband wireless access products,
    facilitates competition in broadband access by providing alternatives to wireline
    broadband access, encourages consistent worldwide spectrum allocations and accelerates
    the commercialization of broadband wireless access systems. The standard is a
    revision of IEEEE Std 802.16-2004, and consoidates material from IEEE 802.16eTM-2005,
    IEEE 802.16-2004/Cor1-2005, IEEE 802.16fTM-2005 and IEEE 802.16gTM-2007, along
    with additional mantenance items and enhancements to the management information
    base specifications. This revision supercedes and makes obsolete IEEE Std 802.16-2004
    and all of its subsequent amendments and corrigenda.
