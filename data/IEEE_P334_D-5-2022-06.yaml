abstract:
- content: It is required that Class 1E motors, with their interfaces, meet or exceed
    the specified performance requirements throughout their service life. This is
    accomplished through a program that includes, but is not limited to, design, qualification,
    production quality control, shipping, storage, installation, operation, maintenance,
    periodic testing, and surveillance. This standard addresses the qualification
    portion of the program. It discusses the requirement for maintenance, repair,
    and surveillance of motors to maintain qualification of motors throughout their
    service life but does not provide detailed guidance about how these programmatic
    items must be implemented and maintained. The qualification requirements of this
    standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability of the motor and/or insulation
    system to perform its safety function(s) under specified service conditions.
