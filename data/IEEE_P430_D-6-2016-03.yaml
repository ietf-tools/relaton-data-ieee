abstract:
- content: This standard establishes uniform procedures for the measurement of radio
    noise generated by corona from overhead power lines and substations. Measurement
    procedures in this standard are also valid for other power-line noise sources
    such as gaps and harmonics; however, most of the precautionary information, analysis,
    and data plotting techniques were written and developed primarily for corona discharges.
    The procedures are not valid for measuring transient radio noise sources that
    occur during breaker or disconnect switching operations. The procedures apply
    in the frequency range of 0.010- MHz to 1000 MHz; however, the emphasis is on
    the standard amplitude-modulation broadcasting (0.535 MHz to -1.605 MHz) and television
    broadcasting (54- MHz to 72 MHz, 76 MHz to -88 MHz, 174 MHz to- 216 MHz, and 470-
    MHz to 698 MHz) bands. This standard is applicable to both ac and dc transmission
    lines and substations.
