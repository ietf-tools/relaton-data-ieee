abstract:
- content: This standard for determination of gamma-ray efficiencies of germanium
    semiconductor detectors was developed in recognition of the increasing number
    of large-volume, low-activity samples being measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy.
    The standardized sample geometry and measurement techniques described, when used
    in conjunction with the relative efficiency measurement standard ANSI/IEEE Std
    325-1971 (Reaff 1977), Test Procedures for Germanium Gamma-Ray Detectors, provide
    a meaningful assessment of detector performance. It is recognized that many Marinelli
    beaker geometries are in use. However, the object of this standard is to specify
    a single configuration for the sole purpose of characterizing detector performance.
