- content: Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution and power class
    expulsion, current-limiting, and combination-type external capacitor fuses and
    accessories, with rated voltages from 1 kV through 38 kV, for protecting shunt
    capacitors complying with IEEE Std 18-2002 and NEMA CP 1-2000, are established
    in this standard. All of these devices are intended for use on AC systems. These
    fuses may be used with capacitor units, groups of units, or entire capacitor banks.

    specific capacitor line [group] and capacitor unit fuse types as follows: a) Current-limiting
    fuses; b) Expulsion fuses; c) Combination of current-limiting and expulsion fuses;
    d) Fuse supports, fuse mountings, and accessories used with fuses of type a),
    type b), and type c); and e) Current-limiting, expulsion, and combination-type
    capacitor fuses [type a), type b), and type c), respectively] used in fuse enclosure
    packages (FEPs). (Superseded by IEEE C37.42-2016.)'
