abstract:
- content: A family of commercially feasible ways for new systems to perform binary
    floating-point arithmetic is defined. This standard specifies basic and extended
    floating-point number formats; add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, remainder,
    and compare operations; conversions between integer and floating-point formats;
    conversions between different floating-point formats; conversions between basic-format
    floating-point numbers and decimal strings; and floating-point exceptions and
    their handling, including nonnumbers.
