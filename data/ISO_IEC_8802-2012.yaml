abstract:
- content: The media access control characteristics for the demand-priority access
    method are specified. The layer management, physical layers, and media that support
    this access method are also specified. Layer and sublayer interface specifications
    are aligned to the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model and
    ISO/IEC 8802 models. Specifications for 100 Mb/s operation over 100 W balanced
    cable (twisted-pair) Categories 3 through 5, 150 &#x03A9; shielded balanced cable,
    and fibre-optic media are included. Optional implementation of redundant links
    to facilitate automatic recovery of network connectivity in case of link or repeater
    failure anywhere in the network path is specified. Rules for connecting redundant
    links within a network are defined.
