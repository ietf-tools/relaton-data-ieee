abstract:
- content: Applications to three-phase electrical utility systems are described in
    this Part VI of the IEEE C62.92(TM) series. Definitions and considerations related
    to system grounding where the dominant sources of system energization are current-regulated
    or power-regulated power conversion devices are provided.
