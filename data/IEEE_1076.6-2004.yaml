abstract:
- content: This document specifies a standard for use of very high-speed integrated
    circuit hardwaredescription language (VHDL) to model synthesizable register-transfer
    level digital logic. Astandard syntax and semantics for VHDL register-transfer
    level synthesis is defined. The subset ofthe VHDL language, which is synthesizable,
    is described, and nonsynthesizable VHDL constructsare identified that should be
    ignored or flagged as errors.
