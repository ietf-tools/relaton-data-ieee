abstract:
- content: This standard addresses the central control room of a nuclear power generating
    station and the overall complex in which this room is housed. The purpose of this
    standard is to provide guidance for the design of the nuclear power plant control
    room complex, which must meet applicable design criteria. Requirements are established
    and recommendations are offered to aid the designer in meeting the applicable
    general design criteria.<<ETX>>
