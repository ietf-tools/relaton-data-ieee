abstract:
- content: This IEC/IEEE standard sets out the requirements for instrumentation to
    monitor spent fuel pool water level and temperature in nuclear facilities as well
    as radiation monitoring in the vicinity of the pool. Prior to the accident at
    Fukushima Daiichi, spent fuel pool monitoring in nuclear power plants was provided
    mainly to enable operators to monitor pool temperature at a location near the
    top of the pool. It was also used to determine that the water level remained below
    the point where flooding of operational areas would be a concern and above the
    level assumed in safety analyses that evaluated the release of fission products
    from the pool in the event of a fuel handling accident. In general, robust spent
    fuel pools protect the fuel from physical damage and use highly reliable coolant
    systems that ensure continuous decay heat removal. Monitoring of the pool cooling
    system and drain taps at the bottom of the pool were considered sufficient to
    confirm pool cooling under operational states and design basis accidents. Because
    these are straightforward measurements, neither IEC SC 45A nor IEEE NPEC considered
    that a standard on this topic was necessary.
