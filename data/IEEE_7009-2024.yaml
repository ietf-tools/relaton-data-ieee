abstract:
- content: A practical, technical baseline of specific methodologies and tools for
    the development, implementation, and use of effective fail-safe mechanisms in
    autonomous and semi-autonomous systems is established in this standard. The standard
    serves as the basis for developers, as well as users and regulators, to design
    fail-safe mechanisms in a robust, transparent, and accountable manner.
