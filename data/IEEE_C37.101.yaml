abstract:
- content: The guide is intended to assist protection engineers in applying relays
    and relaying schemes for protection against stator ground faults on various generator
    grounding schemes. The existing guide is outdated due to rapid technology development.
    Hence, the revised guide includes new stator ground protection principles that
    have evolved with the use of new technologies in relay designs. Additional application
    examples are included, and other issues raised by the users are also addressed.
    The guide is not intended for the selection of generator or ground connection.
