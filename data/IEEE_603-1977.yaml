abstract:
- content: This standard establishes functional and design criteria for nuclear power
    generating station "safety systems," that is, that collection of systems required
    to minimize the probability and magnitude of release of radioactive material to
    the environment by maintaining plant conditions within the allowable limits established
    for each design basis event. These criteria are established to provide a means
    of promoting safe practices for design and evaluation of safety system performance
    and reliability. The criteria herein represent an acceptable basis for ascertaining
    the adequacy of safety system performance and reliability. Adherence to these
    criteria does not necessarily fully establish the adequacy of safety system functional
    performance and reliability. However, omission of any of these criteria will,
    in most instances, be an indication of safety system inadequacy.
