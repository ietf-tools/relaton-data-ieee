abstract:
- content: This recommended practice presents a rationale and recommendations for
    developing emission limits and immunity test levels. These limits and levels are
    representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits are specified
    by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part
    are regulated and hence controlled, which is the case in the US and Canada. Such
    regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from those
    considered in this document. For product immunity, while in some parts of the
    world this is regulated, for the US and Canada, it is not regulated except for
    some types of safety equipment. In this way, adequate immunity is more a quality
    aspect of the product because it does not operate in its intended RF environment,
    the user would deem it of poor design and quality. The immunity test levels described
    in this document are representative of common levels applied internationally.
    However, severe environments (in which levels of electromagnetic disturbance are
    high) require the consideration of applying higher test levels. This is described
    herein. Finally, it should be noted that the entire recommended practice does
    not contain normative requirements, as such practices remain optional.
