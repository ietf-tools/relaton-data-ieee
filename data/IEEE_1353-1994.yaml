abstract:
- content: A C language binding to IEEE Std 1351-1994, a language-independent standard
    defining an application program interface (API) to the ACSE application service
    element from the OSI application layer and the connection-oriented services of
    the presentation layer is defined. The purpose of this API is to support portable
    implementations of application-specific OSI service elements and non-OSI applications<<ETX>>
