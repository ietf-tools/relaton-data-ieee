abstract:
- content: The Standard Letter Designations for Radar-Frequency Bands was first issued
    in 1976 and was written to remove the confusion that developed from the misapplication
    to radar of letter band designations of other microwave frequency users. This
    standard relates the letter terms in common usage to the frequency ranges that
    they represent. The 1984 revision defined the application V and W to a portion
    of the millimeter wave region while retaining the previous letter designators
    for frequencies. The current (2002) revision keeps the same letter band designations,
    includes a change in the definition of millimeter wave frequencies to conform
    to the ITU designation, and revises the notes to Table 1. Table 1 has been modified
    for international applications by including Regions 1 and 3 in addition to Region
    2.
