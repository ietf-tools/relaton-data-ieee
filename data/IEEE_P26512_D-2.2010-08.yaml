abstract:
  content: 'This standard was developed to assist users of IEEE/ISO/IEC 15288:2008,
    Systems engineering System life cycle processes, or IEEE/ISO/IEC 12207:2008, Information
    technology Software life cycle processes, to acquire or supply software user documentation
    as part of the software life cycle processes. It defines the documentation process
    from the acquirers standpoint and the suppliers standpoint. This standard covers
    the requirements for information items used in the acquisition of user documentation
    products: the Acquisition Plan, Document Specification, Statement of Work, Request
    for Proposals, and the proposal. It provides an overview of the software user
    documentation and information management processes which may require acquisition
    and supply of software user documentation products and services. It addresses
    the preparation of requirements for software user documentation. These requirements
    are central to the user documentation specification and Statement of Work. It
    includes requirements for primary document outputs of the acquisition and supply
    process: the Request for Proposal and the Proposal for user documentation products
    and services. It also discusses the use of a Documentation Management Plan and
    a Document Plan as they arise in the acquisition and supply processes. The standard
    is independent of the software tools that may be used to produce documentation,
    and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation. Much of
    its guidance is applicable to user documentation for systems including hardware
    as well as software.'
