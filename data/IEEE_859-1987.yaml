abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2008. This standard is intended to aid the electric power industry
    in reporting and analyzing outage occurrences of transmission facilities. Use
    of systematic, precise definitions, which is essential for meaningful exchange
    of data, is promoted. The outage definitions and indices are intended for use
    in system planning models, operations and maintenance planning, and system design.
    The definitions and indices may not be sufficiently detailed to cover the information
    required for equipment design.
