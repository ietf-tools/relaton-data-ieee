abstract:
- content: This standard provides a mechanical and electrical specification for implementing
    a common interoperable mechanical quick disconnect interconnect system for use
    by industry for interfacing large numbers of electrical signals (digital, analog,
    RF, power, etc.). These large interface panels (receiver and fixture panels) are
    employed primarily in test systems between stimulus/measurement assets and a related
    unit under test (UUT), although any application involving high density contacts
    requiring a quick disconnect interface could benefit. The Receiver is a receptacle
    that is mounted to test system mates with multiple Fixtures, which serve as the
    ¿buffer¿ between the UUT and ATE. Fixtures translate standard I/O signal routing
    offered at the Receiver to a wiring interface that directly connects to the UUT.
    These UUT interfaces can represent cable connectors, direct plug-in (printed circuit
    board edge connectors), sensor monitoring, or manual feedback from the test technician.
