abstract:
- content: This document specifies an exchange format, using the eXtensible Markup
    Language (XML), for exchanging the test description information defining test
    performance, test conditions, diagnostic requirements, and support equipment to
    locate, align, and verify the proper operation of a Unit Under Test (UUT). This
    is in support of the development of Test Program Sets (TPSs) that will be used
    in an automatic test environment.
