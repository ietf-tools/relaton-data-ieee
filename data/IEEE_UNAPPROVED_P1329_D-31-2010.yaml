abstract:
- content: This standard provides techniques for objective measurement of electroacoustic
    and voice switching characteristics of speakerphones that connect directly or
    indirectly to an analog or digital telephone network. Due to the various characteristics
    of speakerphones and the environments in which they operate, not all of the test
    procedures in this standard are applicable to all speakerphones. Application of
    the test procedures to atypical speakerphones should be determined on an individual
    basis.
