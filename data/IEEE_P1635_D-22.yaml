abstract:
- content: Vented lead-acid (VLA), valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), nickel-cadmium
    (Ni-Cd - both fully vented and partially-recombinant types), and Li-ion stationary
    battery installations are discussed in this guide, written to serve as a bridge
    between the electrical designer and the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
    (HVAC) designer. Ventilation of stationary battery installations is critical to
    improving battery life while reducing the hazards associated with hydrogen production
    (hydrogen production is not a concern with Li-ion under normal operating conditions
    [it is under thermal runaway conditions]). This guide describes battery operating
    modes and the hazards associated with each. It provides the HVAC designer with
    the information to provide a cost effective ventilation solution.
