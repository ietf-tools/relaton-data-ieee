abstract:
- content: The specification and test requirements for a linear, single-axis, nongyroscopic
    accelerometer for use in inertial navigation, guidance, and leveling systems are
    defined. A standard specification guide and a compilation of recommended test
    procedures for such accelerometers are provided. Informative annexes are given
    on the various types of such accelerometers (force or pendulous torque rebalance
    with analog or digital output, vibrating beam, and micromechanical) and error
    effects, on filtering, noise, and transient analysis techniques, and on calibration
    and modeling techniques (multipoint tumble analysis, vibration and shock test
    analyses, and geophysical effects in inertial instrument testing).
