abstract:
- content: Guidance is provided to specifiers, users and manufacturers of surge-protective
    devices (SPDs) about the application considerations of SPDs to power distribution
    systems and associated equipment. This guide applies to SPDs to be connected to
    the load side of the service equipment (and main over current protective device)
    of 50 Hz or 60 Hz ac power circuits rated 1000 V ac or less. This guide provides
    information on surge origins, effects of surges, number and magnitude of surge
    events, location categories, power distribution system (PDS) configurations, grounding
    and bonding, SPD specifications, SPD ratings,SPD characteristics, SPD lifetime,
    interactions of SPDs with a PDS, and SPD coordination considerations.
