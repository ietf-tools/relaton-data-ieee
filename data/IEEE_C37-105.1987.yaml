abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. The basic principles, requirements, and methods for qualifying
    Class 1E protective relays and auxiliaries, such as test and control switches,
    terminal blocks, and indicating lamps, for applications in nuclear power generating
    stations are described. The qualification procedure is generic in nature and can
    be used to demonstrate the design adequacy of such equipment under normal, abnormal,
    design-basis-event, and post-design-basis-event conditions. Protective relays
    and auxiliaries located inside primary containment areas in a nuclear power generating
    station are not covered.
