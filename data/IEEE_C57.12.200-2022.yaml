abstract:
- content: Bushings are critical components for power apparatus as their main role
    is to conduct current at high voltage through a grounded barrier. Statistical
    studies have shown that bushing defects such as water ingression and partial discharge
    are among the most important causes for unexpected failures. Dielectric frequency
    response (DFR), sometimes also known as frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS), which
    involves measurement of the bushing capacitance and dielectric losses over a frequency
    range, is an effective method to detect deterioration of bushing insulation. This
    guide applies to the DFR measurement of various types of bushings either in the
    field or in the factory except for gas-insulated bushings.
