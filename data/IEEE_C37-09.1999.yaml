abstract:
- content: The testing procedures for all high-voltage circuit breakers that include
    all voltage ratings above 1000 V ac and comprise both indoor and outdoor types
    having the preferred ratings as listed in ANSI C37.06-1997 are covered. Typical
    circuit breakers covered by these standards have maximum voltage ratings from
    4.76 kV through 800 kV, and continuous current ratings of 600 A, 1200 A, 2000
    A, and 3000 A associated with the various maximum voltage ratings. The test procedures
    verify all assigned ratings, including continuous current, dielectric withstand
    voltages, short-circuit current, transient recovery voltage, and capacitor switching,
    plus associated capabilities such as mechanical endurance, load current, and out-of-phase
    switching. Production test procedures are also included. This standard does not
    cover generator circuit breakers as these are covered in IEEE Std C37.013-1993.
