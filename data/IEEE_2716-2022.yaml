abstract:
- content: Appropriate methods for the characterization of shielding effectiveness
    of the board level shields themselves as well as the way they are mounted on the
    printed circuit board are provided to manufacturers and users of broad level shielding
    in this guide. A guide for the user in the selection of the appropriate test method
    in order to determine the level of shielding provided in the intended application
    will be provided in this guide.
