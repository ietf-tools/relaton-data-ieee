abstract:
- content: Assurance-related terms are defined and an organized set of concepts and
    relationships to establish a basis for shared understanding across user communities
    for assurance are established in this adoption of ISO/IEC 15026-1. It provides
    information to users of the other parts of this International Standard including
    the combined use of multiple parts. The essential concept introduced by ISO/IEC
    15026 is the statement of claims in an assurance caseand the support of those
    claims through argumentation and evidence. These claims are in the context of
    assurance for properties of systems and software within life cycle processes for
    the system or software product.Assurance for a service being operated and managed
    on an ongoing basis is not covered in this International Standard.
