abstract:
- content: The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) pre-standards workstream for Clinical
    Internet of Things (IoT) data validation and interoperability with blockchain
    was initiated to determine if a viable standards framework could be established
    to enable the validation of data generated from a clinical-grade IoT device and
    shared through the interoperability of blockchain technology. Participants in
    the workstream were gathered from an IEEE SA workshop held at Johns Hopkins University
    in Rockville, Maryland in April 2018, and grew to include their network of healthcare
    and Health-IT ecosystem players, as well as participants in prior IEEE SA efforts
    in related areas. The workstream commenced in August 2018 and completed in February
    2019. Participants in this pre-standards workstream who are the authors of this
    paper are listed in Appendix A. The pre-standards workstream led to the recommendation
    of the development of an IEEE SA Standards effort on Clinical IoT data and device
    interoperability with TIPPSS-Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety and
    Security-in connected healthcare to improve data sharing and healthcare outcomes.
    The pre-standards workstream team decided that blockchain is not necessary for
    clinical IoT data and device interoperability and validation, nor does it necessarily
    meet the robust TIPPSS needs in connected healthcare. The workstream recommendation
    includes a draft TIPPSS Architectural Framework for Clinical IoT data validation
    &amp; interoperability, which could include digital ledger technology but does
    not need to do so. The resulting IEEE Standards Association P2733 working group
    to develop a standard for Clinical IoT Data and Device Interoperability with TIPPSS
    kick off meeting is scheduled for July 17, 2019, sponsored by the IEEE SA Engineering
    in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS).
