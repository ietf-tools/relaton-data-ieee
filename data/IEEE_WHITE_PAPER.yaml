abstract:
- content: This white paper provides a broad overview of potential communication technology
    and spectrum usage options for unmanned aerial systems (UAS). This paper particularly
    focuses on the detect and avoid (DAA) or collision avoidance (CA) use case, in
    line with the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) use case
    white paper and examines the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art
    technologies for DAA/CA use case. While specific frequency bands are discussed,
    along with communication requirements of the UAS, solutions for spectrum usage
    designs and experimentation have been reserved for white papers to emanate from
    future IEEE P1920 UAV standard groups.
