abstract:
- content: Standards and codes establish the functional performance requirements of
    equipment interconnecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with an Electric
    Power System (EPS). Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs) evaluate
    equipment for safety and compliance with applicable standards and codes. Equipment
    meeting these requirements are then listed as suitable for their intended use
    in compliance with the applicable requirements. The EPS operator enters into a
    binding agreement with the DER operator for interconnection with the EPS at a
    specific site to meet the requirements of the EPS infrastructure at that location.
    IEEE Conformity Assessment Program proposes a process and procedure to ensure
    compliance with the applicable standards and the interconnection agreement.
