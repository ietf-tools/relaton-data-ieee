abstract:
- content: The future has already arrived in the form of our children. These children
    are raising their voices all around the world, demanding policy makers and technologists
    take the necessary steps to secure their futures. This includes utilizing emerging
    technologies in a way that prioritizes people and planet over power and profits.
    At a physical level, human well being is critically dependent on environmental
    sustainability. Beyond questions of happiness or mood, basic human flourishing
    means having access to potable water and clean air. Our symbiotic relationship
    with nature, however, has been severely damaged due to actions that have resulted
    in a climate crisis that, if not immediately addressed, will lead to irreversible
    ecological and human devastation. A combination of a courageous socioeconomic
    transformation and accelerated technological innovation is necessary to mitigate
    this threat. For more information on this and other similar topics, visit https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/
