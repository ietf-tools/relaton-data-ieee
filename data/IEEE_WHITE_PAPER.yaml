abstract:
- content: This document presents a review of relevant literature (e.g., standards,
    regulations, and scientific publications) that investigated kinematic behavior
    of road users. This review is intended to serve as a key contribution to the Automated
    Driving Systems (ADS) research and industry communities, as well as to current
    standardization efforts, such as IEEE Std 2846, IEEE Standard for Assumptions
    in Safety-Related Models for Automated Driving Systems.
