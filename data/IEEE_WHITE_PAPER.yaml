abstract:
- content: The IEEE SA Transdisciplinary Framework for 5G and Future Networks Enabled
    Applications and Services Industry Connections (IC) white paper discusses the
    end-to-end agriculture ecosystem in the context of the food supply chain, rural
    development, and climate resiliency. A transdisciplinary framework that includes
    ecosystems, networks, and governance may address the end-to-end agriculture ecosystem
    in a sustainable and systematic manner. The food supply chain includes the natural
    environment and resources, food production, processing and packaging, distribution,
    and consumption. Rural development is discussed within the context of connectivity,
    cross-ecosystem touch-points, and local economic development. Climate resiliency
    is addressed through changes in land use and land cover (LULC).
