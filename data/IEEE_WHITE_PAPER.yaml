abstract:
- content: Despite promising collaborative initiatives to develop principles, standards,
    and guidelines to help late adopters of digital health and developing nations
    catch up, policymakers are struggling to adopt and integrate digital technologies
    to their domestic health systems. With a large and growing selection of digital
    tools available, it is a challenge for countries to know what tools are both available
    and important and which tools best suit their context and needs for COVID-19 response
    and recovery and for building resilience to future crises. Underlying the discussions
    in this paper is an urgent need to restore and build greater transparency and
    public trust. The public needs to have confidence that digital solutions to public
    health emergencies protect them, respect their rights and empower them, and do
    not normalize the deployment of mass surveillance as the only way to deal with
    a crisis.
