abstract:
- content: An industry-specific implementation playbook that encourages technologists
    in the financial services to prioritize human wellbeing and ethical considerations
    in the application of data regarding Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS). The
    Playbook incorporates IEEE’s Ethically Aligned Design (first edition), IEEE 7000&#8482;
    series of standards, and ECPAIS certifications to provide a theoretical framework
    for implementing responsible data and AIS in financial institutions while outlining
    the global regulatory landscape with its impacts on the future development of
    AIS and ethics. For more information on this and other similar topics visit https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/
