abstract:
- content: This paper outlines the reasons why next-generation architecture is needed
    that can protect technology, systems, networks, and data in a dynamic risk environment.
    Although the Internet is integral to the flow of information across the globe
    and national boundaries, it was not built for the highly sensitive, critical data
    we see today. Architecture throughout protocol and software application stacks
    is not set up to face the cybersecurity issues. The forward-facing and strategic
    approach introduced here promotes an architecture inherently resilient to cybersecurity
    threats. This approach would also address the needs for 6G technologies, Web X.0,
    Metaverse, and any evolutionary technologies envisioned.
