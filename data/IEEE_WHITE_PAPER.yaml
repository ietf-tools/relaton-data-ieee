abstract:
- content: Optical interconnects are critical to providing reliable and energy efficient
    data transfer between active and passive devices that are pervasive in data centers,
    telecommunications, transportation, and many emerging sectors and use-case scenarios.
    There currently are no standard metrics for assessing the overall performance
    of these connections. This white paper is intended to highlight this gap and initiate
    a dialogue for stakeholders to address the current and potential future needs
    for performance and parametrics that can be uniformly considered across multiple
    optical interconnect technologies.
