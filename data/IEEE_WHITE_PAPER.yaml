abstract:
- content: This paper is the second in a series and delves deeper into the challenges
    and gaps in ensuring a resilient and sustainable smart logistics ecosystem, and
    proposes an integrated multisector smart logistics framework to address these
    challenges and gaps. An integrated multisector smart logistics framework will
    be critical for the sustainable growth of the logistics industry, and in turn
    for commerce and trade, and for the achievement of the sustainable development
    goals (SDGs).
