abstract:
- content: This paper discusses general guidance and methodologies for the determination
    of far-field (FF) peak gain, equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP), and total
    radiated power (TRP) of active antenna systems (AAS) at ranges shorter than the
    classical Fraunhofer distance (FHD).
