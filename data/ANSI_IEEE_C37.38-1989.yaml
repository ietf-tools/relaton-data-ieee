abstract:
- content: Requirements for switches rated 72.5 kV and above, intended for use in
    metal-enclosed, gas-insulated substations, are presented. These switches are characterized
    by grounded, leak-tight metal enclosures that are filled with a gas (most commonly
    sulfur hexafluoride, SF6) at some pressure above atmospheric. Live parts are contained
    within the housing and insulated therefrom by the gas and by suitable solid insulation
    that supports the live parts in their proper position. Gas-insulated switches
    are normally electrically connected to and structurally joined to other gas-insulated
    components, such as buses, gas-to-air bushings, circuit breakers, instrument transformers,
    cable terminations, etc. Switches may be manually or power operated. Service conditions,
    ratings, supporting structures, and nameplates are covered. Testing of disconnecting
    and grounding switches is covered.
