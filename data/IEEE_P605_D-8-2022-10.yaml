abstract:
- content: A proper design of the substation bus aims towards a safe and reliable
    operation of the substation and the power system. Two different types of buses
    are used in substations, the rigid bus and the strain (cable). This guide provides
    information on the different bus arrangements used in substations stating the
    advantages and disadvantages of each. Also it provides information as related
    to each bus type and construction. Once the bus type is selected, this guide provides
    the calculation tools for each bus type. Based on these calculations, the engineer
    can specify the bus size, forces acting on the bus structure, number of mounting
    structures required, and hardware requirements.
