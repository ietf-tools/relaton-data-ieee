abstract:
- content: Class 1E portions of ac and dc power systems and instrument and control
    (I&amp;C) power systems in single-unit and multiunit nuclear power generating
    stations are covered in this standard. The provision of criteria for the determination
    of Class 1E power system design features, criteria for sharing Class 1E power
    systems in multiunit stations, the requirements for their testing and surveillance,
    and the requirements for documentation of the Class 1E power system is the intent
    of this standard.
