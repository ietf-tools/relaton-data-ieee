abstract:
  content: The scope of this project is to augment the capabilities of the IEEE Std
    802.3 standard with higher power levels and improved power management information.
    The project will augment the methodology for the provision of power via balanced
    cabling to connected Data Terminal Equipment with 802.3 interfaces. Optional augmented
    power limit will be made available for certain structured cabling systems. Compatibility
    with existing equipment will be maintained.
