- content: Direction for the implementation of the requirements of IEEE Std 323trade-2003
    as they apply to the specific features of safety-related actuator qualification
    are provided. This standard establishes criteria for qualification of safety-related
    actuators, and actuator components, in Nuclear Power Generating Stations in order
    to demonstrate their ability to perform their intended safety functions under
    all required conditions.
