abstract:
- content: Cyber security measures require that a balance be achieved between technical
    feasibility and economic feasibility, and that this balance addresses the risks
    expected to be present at a substation. Further, cyber security measures must
    be designed and implemented in such a manner that access and operation to legitimate
    activities is not impeded, particularly during times of emergency or restoration
    activity. This standard, presents a balance of the above factors.
