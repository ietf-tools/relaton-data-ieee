abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice defines a message exchange framework based on
    Information Elements as a transport method for key management protocol (KMP) datagrams
    and guidelines for the use of some existing KMPs with the IEEE Std 802.15.4. This
    Recommended Practice does not create a new KMP.This recommended practice also
    provides a generic Multiplexed data service layer that can be usedto transmit
    large packets from the upper layer process to another peer. The Multiplexed data
    serviceprovides a fragmentation and multiplexing layer for those packets so they
    can be delivered oversmaller MAC layer frames and multiplexed on the recipient
    end to the right processing service.
