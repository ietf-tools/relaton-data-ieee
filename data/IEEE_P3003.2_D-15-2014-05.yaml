abstract:
- content: The grounding and bonding of equipment in industrial and commercial power
    systems is covered in this recommended practice. The interconnection and grounding
    of the non-electrical metallic elements of a system is covered first. This is
    followed by a discussion of the objectives of equipment grounding and bonding,
    including minimizing electric shock hazard to personnel, providing adequate current
    carrying capability for ground faults, and ensuring the timely operation of overcurrent
    protection.
