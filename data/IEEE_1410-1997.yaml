abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE 1410-2004. This guide will identify factors that contribute
    to lightning-caused faults on overhead distribution lines and suggest improvements
    to existing and new constructions. This guide is limited to the protection of
    distribution-line insulation for system voltages 69 kV and below. Equipment protection
    considerations are covered in IEEE Std C62.22-1991.
