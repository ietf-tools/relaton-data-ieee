abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the design, installation, and test parameters for
    a broadband cable medium. The medium supports the communication of IEEE 802.3b,
    IEEE 802.4, video, and narrow-band radio frequency (RF) modem devices. The broadband
    bus topology consists of amplifiers, coaxial cable, and directional couplers that
    create a full duplex directional medium. Inbound signals flow from user outlet
    transmitters to a central headend location. The headend processes the signals
    and then transmits the signals via an outbound path to all the user outlets. The
    medium utilizes frequency division multiplexing (FDM), which supports the simultaneous
    coexistence of services. Each service is assigned a unique inbound and outbound
    channel frequency.<<ETX>>
