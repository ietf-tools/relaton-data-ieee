abstract:
- content: Link Aggregation allows parallel full duplex point-to-point links to be
    used as if they werea single link, and also supports the use of multiple links
    as a resilient load sharing interconnectbetween multiple nodes in two separately
    administered networks. This standard defines a MACindependent Link Aggregation
    capability, and general information relevant to specific to MAC types.
