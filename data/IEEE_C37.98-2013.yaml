abstract:
- content: The methods and conditions for seismic qualification of protective relays
    and auxiliaries such as test and control switches, terminal blocks, and indicating
    lamps for use in nuclear facilities are described in this standard. The primary
    intent of this standard is to focus on fragility testing and seismic qualification,
    also known as proof testing (either to generic levels or specific levels). This
    standard covers relays used in nuclear facilities, but may also be applied to
    any area in which the seismic response of relays is a design consideration. The
    prerequisites for the seismic test are defined in IEEE Std C37.105&#x2122;.
