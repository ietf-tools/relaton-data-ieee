abstract:
- content: This recommended practice provides a guide to the conduct and analysis
    of precision centrifuge tests of linear accelerometers and covers each phase of
    the tests, beginning with the planning. Possible error sources and typical methods
    of data analysis are addressed. The intent is to provide users involved in centrifuge
    testing with a detailed understanding of the various factors affecting accuracy
    of measurement, both factors associated with the centrifuge and factors in the
    data collection process. Model equations are discussed, both for the centrifuge
    and for a typical linear accelerometer, each with the complexity needed to accommodate
    the various identified characteristics and error sources in each. An iterative
    matrix equation solution is presented for deriving the various model equation
    coefficients for the accelerometer under test from the centrifuge test data.

- content: This recommended practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision
    tests that are to be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques.
    The term “precision,” in this context, refers to tests that are conducted to evaluate
    accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish environmental
    survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining the coefficients
    of the accelerometer’s model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which
    are most accurately determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively,
    evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer output complies with specific
    error limit criteria.
