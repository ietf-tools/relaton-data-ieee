abstract:
- content: The neutral grounding of single- and three-phase ac electric-utility primary
    distribution systems with nominal voltages in the range of 2.4 kV &#8211; 34.5
    kV is addressed. Classes of distribution-systems grounding are defined. Basic
    considerations in distribution-system grounding concerning economics, control
    of temporary over voltages, control of ground-fault currents, and ground relaying
    are addressed. Also considered is the use of grounding transformers, grounding
    of high-voltage neutral of wye-delta distribution transformers, and interconnection
    of primary and secondary neutrals of distribution transformers.
