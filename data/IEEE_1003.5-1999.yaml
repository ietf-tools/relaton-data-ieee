abstract:
- content: 'This standard is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications
    and user interfaces to open systems. It defines the Ada language bindings as package
    specifications and accompanying textual descriptions of the application program
    interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the source
    code level through the binding between ISO 8652: 1995 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:
    1996 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1996) (POSIX), as amended by IEEE P1003.1g/D6.6. Terminology
    and general requirements, process primitives, the process environment, files and
    directories, input and output primitives, device- and class-specific functions,
    language-specific services for Ada, system databases, synchronization, memory
    management, execution scheduling clocks and timers, message passing, task management,
    the XTI and sockets detailed network interfaces, event management, network support
    functions, and protocol-specific mappings are covered. It also specifies behavior
    to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada compilation system.'
