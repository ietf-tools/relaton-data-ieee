abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice describes procedures that electric utility companies
    and others may use to address complaints of interference caused by power-line
    gap noise to radio, television, and other types of wireless communications. It
    includes discussion on how to determine if a noise may be considered as harmful
    interference under the FCC rules. Modern noise-locating techniques, equipment
    and protocols are also described, including the use of time-domain noise signatures
    (sometimes referred to as signature analysis) to investigate and identify radio
    noise in the field. These techniques allow an interference investigator to identify
    which noise source or sources are associated with the reported interference, thus
    minimizing troubleshooting and repair costs. Troubleshooting and repair recommendations
    are also included once all the sources have been identified. This Recommended
    Practice also describes ways to determine and find interference when it is being
    caused by a source other than electric-utility equipment, such as an electronic
    consumer device. The methods and techniques contained herein have been validated
    by decades of usage with positive results by a wide range of users, including
    but not limited to utilities, professional interference investigators, radio engineers,
    and even the home hobbyist.
