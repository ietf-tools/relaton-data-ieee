abstract:
- content: Assistance is provided for the selection of the most appropriate type of
    low-voltage data, communications, and/or signalling circuit surge protector for
    a particular application or set of conditions. Surge protector functions and characteristics
    are also explained and evaluated. AC power circuit applications are not addressed
    in this document.
