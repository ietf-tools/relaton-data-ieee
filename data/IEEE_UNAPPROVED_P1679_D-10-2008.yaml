abstract:
- content: This document covers recommended information for an objective evaluation
    of an emerging energy storage technology by a potential user for any stationary
    application. Energy storage technologies are those that provide a means for the
    reversible storage of electrical energy, i.e. the device receives electrical energy
    and is able to discharge electrical energy at a later time. The storage medium
    may be electrochemical (e.g. batteries), kinetic (e.g. flywheels), electrostatic
    (e.g. electric double-layer capacitors), thermal, or some other medium. Devices
    recharged by non-electrical means, such as fuel cells, are beyond the scope of
    this document. The document provides a common basis for the expression of performance
    characteristics and the treatment of life-testing data. A standard approach for
    analysis of failure modes is also provided, including assessment of safety attributes.
    The intent of this document is to ensure that characterization information, including
    test conditions and limits of applicability, is sufficiently complete to allow
    valid comparisons to be made.
