abstract:
- content: Equipment for three-phase alternating-current (ac) systems having a system
    voltage above 1 kV nominal is discussed. Except for some definitions, this standard
    includes only phase-to-ground insulation. The object of this standard is to guide
    the preparation of specifications for insulation of the various items of equipment
    in a given installation.
