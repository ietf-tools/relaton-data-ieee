abstract:
- content: This standard serves to aid the comparison of the relative merits of magnetostrictive,
    electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostrictive transducers. The standard
    applies generally to magnetostrictive materials and was developed for those working
    on transducer applications. This revised standard was generated because of the
    development of a class of alloys that has made magnetostrictive materials more
    competitive with electrostrictive materials, especially for lower frequency applications.<<ETX>>
