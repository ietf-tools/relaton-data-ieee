abstract:
- content: This document provides requirements for the management of the content used
    in product life cycle, software, and service management system information for
    users. Content management allows an organization to control the storage and retrieval
    of content objects, track content revisions, maintain a content audit trail, and
    enable a collaborative environment. Component content management supports multiple
    deliverable formats and the reuse of content objects among deliverables. Content
    objects that are unique and are maintained as independent database objects are
    efficient to review, approve, and update; may be combined to produce multiple
    deliverables; and are cost-effective to translate. This document defines the characteristics
    of an effective and efficient process through which content is gathered, managed,
    and published, including the requirements of a system that is supported by an
    electronic database. Such a database should support documents or topics and content
    units that may be assembled to produce complete documents for print, electronic
    output, or other content published through electronic media. This database is
    defined as a component content management system (CCMS), as distinct from a document
    management system. The objective of component content management is to create
    content objects once and use them through linking mechanisms in multiple output
    formats including but not limited to documents. Systems conforming to this document
    can fulfil business needs for content development and management, especially the
    need for a single source of authoritative information. This document includes
    business case considerations for acquisition of a content management system. This
    document is independent of the software tools and markup languages that may be
    used to manage information for users and applies to both printed and on-screen
    information for users.
