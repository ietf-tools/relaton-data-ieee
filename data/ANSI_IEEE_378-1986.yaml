abstract:
- content: This standard was written for users and manufacturers of automatic network
    analyzers. The purpose of the standard is to provide common terminology, to give
    performance parameters required for describing and specifying network analyzers,
    and to provide assistance in verifying performance. Automatic network analyzers
    are used to measure complex reflection and transmission characteristics of one-
    and two-port devices at radio and microwave frequencies. Measurement uncertainties
    are a function of both the magnitude and phase angle of the device under test
    as well as the frequency. This standard specifies a set of useful reference networks
    or standard devices that may be used for verification. A network analyzer as considered
    is any system that measures two-port transmission or one-port reflection of multiports.
    A wide variety of attention and impedance measurement equipment is of concern.<<ETX>>
