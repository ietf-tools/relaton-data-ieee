abstract:
- content: This standard is intended to cover procedures for compliance testing of
    a wide variety of transmitters designed to operate in licensed radio services,
    including but not limited to:Commercial Mobile Radio Services, Public Mobile Services,
    Cellular Radiotelephone Service, Personal Communication Services, Miscellaneous
    Wireless Communication Services, PrivateLand Mobile Radio Services, and Personal
    Radio Services. Tests methods are provided for measurement of radiated and conducted
    emissions, RF power, out-of-band emissions, frequencystability, and other regulatory
    requirements for a variety of devices. This standard does not consider test methods
    for requirements specific to maritime and aviation transmitters, ground-based
    radars, satellite equipment, fixed microwave equipment, or broadcast transmitters.
    The latter equipment may be covered in future revisions of this standard.
