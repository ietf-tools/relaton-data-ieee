abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 421.2-1990, IEEE Guide for Identification, Testing, and Evaluation
    of the Dynamic Performance of Excitation Control Systems, presents dynamic performance
    criteria, definitions, and test objectives for excitation control systems as applied
    by electric utilities. It should be specifically noted that the term “excitation
    control system” refers to the entire control system including the synchronous
    machine and power system as well as the excitation system.
