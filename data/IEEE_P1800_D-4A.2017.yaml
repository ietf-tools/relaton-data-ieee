abstract:
- content: The definition of the language syntax and semantics for SystemVerilog,
    which is a unified hardware design, specification, and verification language,
    is provided. This standard includes support for modeling hardware at the behavioral,
    register transfer level (RTL), and gate-level abstraction levels, and for writing
    testbenches using coverage, assertions, object-oriented programming, and constrained
    random verification. The standard also provides application programming interfaces
    (APIs) to foreign programming languages. (The PDF of this standard is available
    at no cost at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=80
