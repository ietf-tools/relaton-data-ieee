abstract:
- content: This amendment specifies the changes required to IEEE 802.5, 1999 Edition
    (ISO/IEC8802-5:1998 base standard), IEEE Stds 802.5r and 802.5j, 1998 Edition
    (ISO/IEC 8802-5:1998/Amd. 1:1998), and IEEE Std 802.5t-1999, to support 1000 Mbit/s
    Dedicated Token Ring (DTR) operation. The base standard together with Amendment
    1 specifies shared and dedicated (point-to-point) Token Ring operation at both
    4 and 16 Mbit/s using either the TKP Access Protocol or theTXI Access Protocol.
    IEEE Std 802.5t-2000 extends Token Ring operation to 100 Mbit/s for the DTR C-Port
    and Station using the TXI Access Protocol. This standard extends Token Ring opera-tion
    to 1000 Mbit/s for the DTR C-Port and Station using the TXI Access Protocol. Extensions
    to the Media Access Control have been made to accommodate the requirements for
    the 1000 Mbit/s media rate.
