abstract:
- content: This standard replaces IEEE Std 1073.3.2-2000. A connection-oriented transport
    profile and physical layer suitable for medical device communications in legacy
    devices is established. Communications services and protocols consistent with
    specifications of the Infrared Data Association are defined. These communication
    services and protocols are optimized for use in patient-connected badside medical
    devices.
