abstract:
- content: This standard defines an extension framework based on IEEE Std 2140.1-2020.
    The extension framework uses a Smart Contract mechanism to process transactions
    on an exchange, to replace the role of exchange operators. This standard also
    defines a series of extensible interfaces for the exchange scenario, enabling
    support of third-party financial derivatives using tokens.
