abstract:
- content: This standard applies to enclosed low-voltage ac power circuit breakers
    as described in American National Standard for Low-Voltage AC Power Circuit Breakers
    Used in Enclosures, C37.13-1973 (IEEE Std 20-1973), except that the circuit breakers
    discussed in this standard incorporate current-limiting fuses as an integral part
    of the circuit breaker. The entire device thereby becomes capable of interrupting
    shortcircuit currents up to 200 000 A rms and may be applied on circuits where
    the available short-circuit current does not exceed that amount.
