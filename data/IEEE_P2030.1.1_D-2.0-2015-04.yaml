abstract:
- content: Direct Current Charging or DC Charging is a method of charging which facilitates
    rapid energy transfer from the electric grid to plug in vehicles. This method
    of charging allows significantly more current to be drawn by the vehicle vs. lower
    rated alternating current (AC) systems. A combination of vehicles which can accept
    high current DC charge, and the DC supply equipment which provides it has led
    to the use of terminology such as Fast Charging, Fast Charger, DC Charger, Quick
    Charger, etc.DC charging and AC charging vary by the location at which AC current
    is converted to DC current. For typical DC charging, the current is converted
    at the off board charger which is separate from the vehicle. For AC charging the
    current is converted inside the vehicle, by means of an on- board -charger. The
    location of the AC to DC conversion equipment, or converter, shapes the complexity
    of the equipment design. Regarding AC charging, as mentioned above, the conversion
    is on-board the vehicle. This allows the OEM designed systems to control the charging
    operation in its entirety. The on-board-charger (converter) and battery controller
    solution is under direct control of the vehicle manufacturer. For DC charging,
    an entirely new challenge for OEMs exists. The DC charger is now external to the
    vehicle and requires the vehicle engineers to control an external power device.
    For the reason of necessary interoperability, standards such as IEEE P2030.1.1
    are provided to assist developers.
