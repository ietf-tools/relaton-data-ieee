abstract:
- content: Overhead transmission line galloping is common in many countries, and the
    measurement and research for galloping have become increasingly necessary. Meanwhile,
    the development of machine vision technology provides a good technical basis for
    the field measurement of galloping. Galloping measurement is to obtain its characteristic
    parameters, such as galloping amplitude, frequency, loops number, and traces,
    which are the basis for galloping mechanism research and anti-galloping scheme
    development. In order to guide the field measurement of galloping, this guide
    has been developed to specify the monocular video-based measurement process, data
    processing and analysis method. The measuring method recommended in this guide
    has such advantages as non-contact, multi-point synchronous, and wide range measurement.
