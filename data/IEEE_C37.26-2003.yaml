abstract:
- content: This guide provides methods for determining the value of power factor for
    inductive low-voltage (1000 volts ac and below) test circuits. These methods are
    used in determining power factor during short-circuit current tests in high power
    laboratories. It is preferred that these methods be used during short-circuit
    current testing. Alternatively, other methods (including use of computerized or
    digital techniques) may be used, but the method used must have been validated
    as producing results equivalent to those obtained using the methods in this guide.
    The methods described are intended for use in low-voltage test circuits (under
    1000 volts ac), but may also be used for higher voltages.
