abstract:
- content: Promoting and facilitating interoperability between components of automatic
    test systems where test results and/or maintenance actions need to be shared is
    addressed in this standard. The standard defines the common elements between both
    test results data and maintenance action data. The common schema becomes a class
    of information that shall be used within the SIMICA family of standards.
