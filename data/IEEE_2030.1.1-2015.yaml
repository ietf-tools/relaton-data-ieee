abstract:
- content: Direct-current (dc) charging is a method of charging that facilitates rapid
    energy transfer from the electric grid to plug-in vehicles. This method of charging
    allows significantly more current to be drawn by the vehicle versus lower rated
    alternating-current (ac) systems. A combination of vehicles that can accept high-current
    dc charge and the dc supply equipment that provides it has led to the use of terminology
    such as fast charging, fast charger, dc charger, quick charger, etc. DC charging
    and ac charging vary by the location at which ac current is converted to dc current.
    For typical dc charging, the current is converted at the off-board charger, which
    is separate from the vehicle. For ac charging, the current is converted inside
    the vehicle, by means of an on-board charger. The location of the ac to dc conversion
    equipment, or converter, shapes the complexity of the equipment design. Regarding
    ac charging, as previously mentioned, the conversion is on boardthe vehicle. This
    allows the original equipment maker (OEM) designed systems to control the charging
    operation in its entirety. The on-board charger (converter) and battery controller
    solutionis under direct control of the vehicle manufacturer. For dc charging,
    an entirely new challenge exists for OEMs. The dc charger is now external to the
    vehicle and requires the vehicle engineers to control an external power device.
    For the reason of necessary interoperability, standards such as IEEE Std 2030.1.1
    are provided to assist developers.
