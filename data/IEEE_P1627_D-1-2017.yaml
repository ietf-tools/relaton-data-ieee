abstract:
- content: This standard is a basis for the design and application of dc surge protection
    devices to protect Overhead Contact System (OCS) from transient overvoltages associated
    with lightning and switching surges. Switching surges are inherent characteristics
    of electrification system and are generally considered low energy transient overvoltages.
    Lightning surges are natural, caused by electrical discharge that occurs in the
    atmosphere between clouds or between clouds and ground. Lightning surges are known
    for causing very high energy transient overvoltages by direct or indirect coupling
    with OCS. This standard covers transient overvoltage protection of OCS and third
    rail used in dc transit electrification system. Transient overvoltage protection
    of positive electrical conductors and the respective negative return system including
    running rails can be achieved by the application of same type of surge protection
    devices. Although running rails are less likely to be affected by lightning transient
    overvoltages due to their proximity to earth, flash-over can occur to drain surge
    energy away from the rails without the application of surge overvoltage protection
    devices. The subject of application of lightning protection devices to running
    rails (where such lightning protection devices may be required, especially in
    areas where lightning activity is severe) will require reviews and protection
    consideration of rail-ground shorting devices along with surge protection device
    rating. It is known that all modern light rail transit (LRT) projects and heavy
    rail transit projects use rail-ground shorting devices (when rail-ground voltage
    exceed set limit for certain time duration) for safety of personnel from the undesirable
    rail-ground voltage appearing at the train vehicle surface when train is located
    at the passenger station or somewhere else on the track rails. Therefore, the
    application of surge protection devices to rails will require special studies
    performing reviews and coordination of surge protection devices with the rail-ground
    shorting devices, as called voltage limiting devices [B37]. This type of special
    study can’t be covered in this standard as theree are no industry standards in
    North America that exist today on rail-ground shorting devices, otherre than IEC
    standard [B37]. The word surge arrester instead of lightning arrester and earth
    instead of ground have been used in this standard without affecting the technical
    contents of the standard.
