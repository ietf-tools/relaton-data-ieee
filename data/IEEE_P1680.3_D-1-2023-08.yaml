abstract:
- content: A clear and consistent set of environmental performance criteria for the
    design of televisions is established, providing an opportunity for manufacturers
    to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of
    electronic products. This standard is also intended to provide a tool for government,
    institutional, corporate, and consumer purchasers to identify products that demonstrate
    environmental leadership. This standard is intended to be updated and revised
    on a periodic basis to continue to set a higher performance standard for leadership
    products.
