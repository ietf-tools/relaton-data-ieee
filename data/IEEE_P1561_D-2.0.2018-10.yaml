abstract:
- content: This guide is applicable to lead-acid batteries that are used as the energy
    storage component in remote hybrid power supplies. The remote hybrid application,
    with its dual generator option, i.e., both renewable and dispatchable generation,
    is advantageous in that the battery can usually be charged at will and under circumstances
    that may also be advantageous for the dispatchable generator.
