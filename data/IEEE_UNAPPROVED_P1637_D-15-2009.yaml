abstract:
- content: This guide has been developed to provide a step-by-step process for selecting
    an appropriate termination that is commensurate with a particular shielded power
    cable design. Over the years, shielded power cables have been developed that employ
    many different insulating materials and many different shielding systems, such
    that, there are numerous issues to consider when selecting a termination for a
    particular cable design. Over the same period of time, many different termination
    methods and designs have been developed that serve the same purpose, but employ
    different application methodologies.
