abstract:
- content: This standard defines an extensible IEEE 802(R) media access independent
    services framework (i.e., function and protocol) that enables the optimization
    of services including handover and other services when performed between heterogeneous
    IEEE 802 networks. It also facilitates these services when networking between
    IEEE 802 networks and Cellular networks.
