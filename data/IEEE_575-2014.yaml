abstract:
- content: The most common shield/sheath-bonding systems now in use on medium through
    extra high-voltage (5 kV to 500 kV) single-conductor shielded power cables and
    the methods of calculating the corresponding shield/sheath voltages and currents,
    when the cables are operated as part of a three-phase system, with the neutral
    grounded directly or through an impedance, are described in this guide.
