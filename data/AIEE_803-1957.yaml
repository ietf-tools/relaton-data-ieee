abstract:
- content: The extremes of aircraft environment and rigorous reliability requirements,
    make special consideration of aircraft insulation testing procedure desirable.
    Operating temperatures, in some classes of equipment now above 260C (SOOF), are
    moving upward. Ambient low temperatures below -6SC (-8SF) are currently specified.Vibration
    conditions producing accelerations in excess of 60 G's exist. Environmental conditions
    which may deteriorate electrical insulation are present through a range and to
    a degree uncommon in the environment of non-aircraft electric equipment. These
    conditions have created problems which commercial insulation test procedures do
    not always cover adequately.
