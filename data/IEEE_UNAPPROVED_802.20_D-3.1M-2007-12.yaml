abstract:
- content: These technical requirements form a compatibility standard for mobile broadband
    wireless access systems. The requirements ensure that a compliant Access Terminal
    (AT) or User Terminal (UT) can obtain service through any Access Network or Base
    Station (BS) conforming to properly selected modes of this standard, consistent
    with equipment and operator requirements, thus providing a framework for the rapid
    development of cost-effective, interoperable multivendor mobile broadband wireless
    access systems. This compatibility standard is targeted for use in a wide variety
    of licensed frequency bands and regulatory environments. This specification includes
    provisions for future service additions and expansion of system capabilities.
    The architecture defined by this specification permits such expansion without
    the loss of backward compatibility to older access terminals or user terminals.
