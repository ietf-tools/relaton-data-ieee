abstract:
- content: Reaffirmed 2008. Names and letter symbols for prefixes that denote multiplication
    of a unit by the binary multiplier 2 10 n ,where n =1,2,3,4,5,or 6 are defined.
    Although the prefixes may be used with all units in all fields where multiplication
    by a binary multiplier is found to be appropriate, their primary use is in the
    field of information technology.
