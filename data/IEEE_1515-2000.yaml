abstract:
- content: This recommended practice defines many common parameters for ac-dc and
    dc-dc electronic power distribution components and subsystems. This enables electronic
    system engineers, manufacturers, and researchers to speak with a common language
    and hence facilitates effective and efficient communications. Furthermore, implementation
    of a common specification language will allow the power electronics industry as
    well as the user communities, including government system developers, to acquire
    cost and time-effective electronic power subsystems with significantly enhanced
    interchangeability.
