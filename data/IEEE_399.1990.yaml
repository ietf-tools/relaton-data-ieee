abstract:
- content: 'Superseded by 399-1997. This recommended practice is a reference source
    for engineers involved in industrial and commercial power systems analysis. It
    contains a thorough analysis of the power system data required, and the techniques
    most commonly used in computer-aided analysis, in order to perform specific power
    system studies of the following: short-circuit, load flow, motorstarting, cable
    ampacity, stability, harmonic analysis, switching transient, reliability, ground
    mat, protective coordination, DC auxiliary power system, and power system modeling.'
