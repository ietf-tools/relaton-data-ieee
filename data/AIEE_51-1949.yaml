abstract:
- content: This report deals with dielectric tests on completed apparatus. Tests on
    materials and on components during the course of fabrication usually are left
    to the discretion of the manufacturer and are not a subject foe standardization
    except as to method and technique. Impulse test values where specified in standards
    are based on the Basic Impulse Levels and thus are consistent for different equipment.
    Impulse test conditions and technique are outside the scope. Hence, this report
    deals mostly with conditions and test values associated with low-frequency dielectric
    tests.
