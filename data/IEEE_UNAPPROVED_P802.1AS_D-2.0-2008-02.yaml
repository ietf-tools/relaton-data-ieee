abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the protocol and procedures used to ensure that
    the synchronization requirements are met for time sensitive applications, such
    as audio and video, across Bridged and Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks consisting
    of LAN media where the transmission delays are fixed and symmetrical; for example,
    IEEE 802.3 full duplex links. This includes the maintenance of synchronized time
    during normal operation and following addition, removal, or failure of network
    components and network reconfiguration. It specifies the use of IEEE 1588 specifications
    where applicable in the context of IEEE Stds 802.1D and 802.1Q. Synchronization
    to an externally provided timing signal (e.g., a recognized timing standard such
    as UTC or TAI) is not part of this standard but is not precluded
