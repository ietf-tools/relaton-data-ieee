abstract:
- content: Data messages, known as protocol data units (PDUs), that are exchanged
    on a network between simulation applications are defined. These PDUs are for interactions
    that take place within specified domains called protocol families, which include
    Entity Information/Interaction, Warfare, Logistics, Simulation Management, Distributed
    Emission Regeneration, Radio Communications, Entity Management, Minefield, Synthetic
    Environment, Simulation Management with Reliability, Live Entity Information/Interaction,
    and Non-Real Time.
