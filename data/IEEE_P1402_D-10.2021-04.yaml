abstract:
  content: This guide describes recommended practices for the physical security of
    electric power substations. It is designed to address a number of threats, including
    unauthorized access to substation facilities, theft of material, and vandalism.
    It describes options for positive access control, monitoring of facilities, and
    delay/deter features which could be employed to mitigate these threats. This guide
    also establishes options for different levels of physical security for electric
    power substations. The guide does not establish recommendations based on voltage
    levels, size or any depiction of criticality of the substation. The user will
    make these decisions based on threat assessment and criticality assignment by
    the substation owner. Overt attacks against the substation for the purpose of
    destroying its capability to operate, such as explosives, projectiles, vehicles,
    etc. are beyond the scope of this guide.
