abstract:
- content: A set of processes by which organizations seek to make their services age
    appropriate is established in this standard. The growing desire of organizations
    to design digital products and services with children in mind and reflects their
    existing rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
    (the Convention) is supported by this standard. While different jurisdictions
    may have different laws and regulations in place, the best practice for designing
    digital services that impact directly or indirectly on children is offered by
    this standard. It sets out processes through the life cycle of development, delivery
    and distribution, that will help organizations ask the right relevant questions
    of their services, identify risks and opportunities by which to make their services
    age appropriate and take steps to mitigate risk and embed beneficial systems that
    support increased age appropriate engagement. One in three users online is under
    18, which means that this standard has wide application.
