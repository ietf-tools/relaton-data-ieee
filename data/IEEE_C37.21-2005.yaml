abstract:
- content: This standard covers ratings, construction, and testing of dead-front control
    switchboards containing but not limited to devices such as switches, control devices,
    instrumentation, metering, monitoring, alarms, annunciators, protective and auxiliary
    relays, and regulating devices and accessories. It includes, but is not specifically
    limited to, switchboards for the control and protection of apparatus used for
    or associated with power generation, conversion, transmission, and distribution.
    Types of switchboards may include control, vertical, dead-front, enclosed, dual,
    or duplex switchboards. Other construction types include control desks, consoles,
    benchboards, dual or duplex benchboards, fixed rack, cabinet, and swing rack cabinets.
    It does not apply to industrial controls, communication equipment, switchboards
    for use on board ships, or Class 1E switchboards for use in nuclear generating
    stations.
