abstract:
- content: SUPERSEDED BY IEEE STD 528-2001. Terms and definitions relating to inertial
    sensors are presented. Usage as understood by the inertial sensor community is
    given preference over general technical usage of the terms herein. The criterion
    for inclusion of a term and its definition in this document is usefulness as related
    to inertial sensor technology.
