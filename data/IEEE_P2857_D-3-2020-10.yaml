abstract:
- content: This document describes a complete communications specification, encompassing
    layers 1 to 4 of the Open Systems Integration (OSI) network model, for a secure,
    wireless mesh communications network, using open standards communications and
    cybersecurity standards from standards organizations including Institute of Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The
    specification describes the functionality of the physical (PHY layer), medium
    access control (MAC layer), the network layer, transport layer and security parameters
    including certificate format for a highly scaleable and secure wireless mesh network
    for critical infrastructure ipv6 wireless communications networks.
