abstract:
- content: Service conditions and definitions for high-voltage fuses (above 1,000
    V), distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches,
    and accessories for ac distribution systems are covered. These include enclosed,
    open, and open-link types of distribution cutouts and fuses; distribution current-limiting
    fuses; distribution oil cutouts; distribution enclosed single-pole air switches;
    power fuses, including current-limiting types; outdoor and indoor fuse disconnecting
    switches; fuse supports, mountings, hooks, and links, all of the type used exclusively
    with the above; and removable switch blades for certain products among the above.
