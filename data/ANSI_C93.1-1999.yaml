abstract:
- content: This standard applies to capacitors for coupling power-line carriers and
    for reducing rate of rise of breaker transient recovery voltage, and to coupling
    capacitor voltage transformers (CCVT) for connection to a high voltage power circuit,
    between line and ground, to supply a low voltage for measurement, control, and
    protective functions. A CCVT may or may not have provision for power-line carrier
    coupling. This standard does not include bushing potential devices, or secondary
    compensated-field adjustable CCVTs.
