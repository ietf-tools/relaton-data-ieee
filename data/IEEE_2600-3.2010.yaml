abstract:
- content: A Protection Profile for Hardcopy Devices in a public-facing environment
    is provided in this standard in which document security is not guaranteed, but
    access control and usage accounting are important to the operator of the environment.
    A retail copy center, public library, Internet cafe, and hotel business center
    are typical applications of this environment. This environment will be known as
    "Operational Environment C".
