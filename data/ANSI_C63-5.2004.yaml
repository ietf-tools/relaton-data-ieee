- content: Methods for determining antenna factors of antennas used for radiated emission
    measurements of electromagnetic interference (EMI) from 9 kHz to 40 GHz are provided.
    Antennas included are linearly polarized antennas such as loops, rods (monopoles),
    tuned dipoles, biconical dipoles, log-periodic dipole arrays, hybrid linearly
    polarized arrays, broadband horns, etc., which are used in measurements governed
    by ANSI C63.4-2001. The methods include standard site (i.e. 3-antenna), reference
    antenna, equivalent capacitance substitution, standard transmitting loop, standard
    antenna, and standard field methods.
