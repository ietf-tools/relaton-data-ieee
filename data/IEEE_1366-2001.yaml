abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 1366-2003. Useful distribution reliability indices,
    and factors that affect their calculation, are identi-fied. This guide includes
    indices that are useful today as well as ones that may be useful in thefuture.
    The indices are intended to apply to distribution systems, substations, circuits,
    and definedregions.
