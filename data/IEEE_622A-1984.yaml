abstract:
- content: Recommended practices for designing and installing electric pipe heating
    control and alarm systems, as applied to mechanical piping systems that require
    heat, are provided. The recommendations include selection of control and alarm
    systems, accuracy considerations, local control usage, centralized control usage,
    qualification criteria of controls and alarms, and calibration and testing of
    controls and alarms. The intent is to ensure design consistency and reliable operation
    of electric pipe heating control and alarm systems, which in turn will ensure
    that piping system fluids will be available for use not only during station operation
    but also during normal shutdown.
