abstract:
- content: Series-Connected dry-type air-core single-phase and three-phase outdoor
    or indoor reactors of distribution and transmission voltage class that are connected
    in the power system to control power flow under steady-state conditions and/or
    limit fault current under short-circuit conditions are covered. Dry-Type air-core
    reactors covered by this standard are self-cooled by natural air convection. With
    some restrictions, other reactors, including shunt capacitor reactors (used with
    shunt capacitor banks), filter reactors, shunt capacitor reactors (used with series
    capacitor banks), and discharge current-limiting reactors, are also covered.
