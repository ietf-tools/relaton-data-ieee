abstract:
- content: Series-connected dry-type air-core single-phase and three-phase outdoor
    or indoor reactors of distribution and transmission voltage class that are connected
    in power systems to control power flow under steady-state conditions and/or limit
    fault current under short-circuit conditions are covered. Dry-type air-core reactors
    covered by this standard are self-cooled by natural air convection. With some
    restrictions, other reactors, including filter reactors, shunt capacitor reactors
    (used with shunt capacitor banks) and discharge current limiting reactors (used
    with series capacitor banks), are also covered.
