abstract:
- content: 'Interface and functional specifications of cellular communication terminals
    installed on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are presented in this recommended practice.
    The specifications are described in four categories: the terminals’ interface
    and functional specifications, specifications of data transmission, environmental
    and reliability specifications, and safety practice. The terminals’ functional
    specifications include the power management, cellular network communication, flight
    data and payload data collection, procession and transmission, device management,
    and safety management. The terminals’ interface specifications are the specifications
    of the electrical interface and electromechanical interface. The electrical interface
    refers to the power supply interface, communication interface, human-machine interface,
    and antenna interface. Data transmission are the flight data and payload data
    transmission protocols and terminals’ payload data safety practice. Finally, the
    terminals’ interface environmental, reliability and electromagnetic compatibility
    are presented.'
