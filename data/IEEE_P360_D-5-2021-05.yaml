abstract:
- content: Wearable Consumer Electronic Devices (Wearables) are given an overview,
    terminology, and categorization in this standard. An architecture for a series
    of standard specifications that define technical requirements and testing methods
    for different aspects of wearables--from basic security and suitableness of wear
    to various functional areas, such as health, fitness, and infotainment--is further
    outlined.
