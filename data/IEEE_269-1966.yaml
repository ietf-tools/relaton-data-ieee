abstract:
- content: The purpose of this Standard is to describe a practical and reproducible
    method for measuring the transmission characteristics of a telephone set, and
    the components thereof, by means of objective measurements in a test connection.
    Performance characteristics obtained using this method will approximate but will
    not duplicate performance under actual use conditions. The method requires a suitable
    Artificial Mouth. It also specifies a standard Artificial Ear, standard circuits
    comprising direct-current power feed and connecting loops, and a standard pressure
    microphone. This Standard is intended for use in measuring the transmission characteristic
    over the frequency range most useful for speech, e.g. 150 to 5000 hertz. It is
    to be used for single-frequency measurements and for measurements with continuously
    varying frequencies such as slow sweeps and warble bands. It is suitable also
    for measuring the transmission performance of conventional telephone sets equipped
    with handsets using carbon transmitters and used with 2-wire circuits. It is not
    intended to be applicable to special devices such as noise-exclusion transmitters,
    distant-talking transmitters, insert-type receivers, or noise-exclusion receivers
    equipped with large ear pads. This Standard is based on a standard pressure microphone
    to measure the sound field produced by the Artificial Mouth and to measure the
    pressure developed in the Artificial Ear. Drawings and test procedures as well
    as other pertinent information have been included as an aid to designers in setting
    up the tests.performance.
