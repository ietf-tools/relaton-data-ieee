abstract:
- content: This standard provides a set of application layer messaging services that
    are applicable for the enterprise and End Device ends of an Advanced Metering
    Infrastructure (AMI). The application services include those useful for managing
    the AMI network assets defined by this standard. These messages may be transported
    over a wide range of underlying network transports such as TCP/IP, UDP, IEEE 802.11,
    IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.16, PLC and SMS over GSM, over a wide range of physical
    media. Additionally, interfaces are defined for a Communication Module and a Local
    Port (e.g. an IEEE 1701 optical port). The described protocol is tailored for,
    but not limited to, the transport of IEEE 1377 Table data. The standard also provides
    a means by which information can be sent in a secure manner using AES-128 and
    the EAX¿ mode. This standard was developed jointly with ANSI (published as ANSI
    C12.22) and Measurement Canada (published as MC1222).
