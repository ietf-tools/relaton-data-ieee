abstract:
- content: The scope of this document is the independence requirements of the circuits
    and equipment comprising or associated with Class 1E systems. It sets forth criteria
    for the independence that can be achieved by physical separation and electrical
    isolation of circuits and equipment which are redundant but does not address the
    determination of what is to be considered redundant.
