abstract:
- content: Capacitors rated 216 V or higher, 2.5 kvar or more, and designed for shunt
    connection to alternating-current transmission and distribution systems operating
    at a nominal frequency of 50 or 60 Hz are considered. Service conditions, ratings,
    manufacturing, and testing are covered. A guide to the application and operation
    of power capacitors is included.
