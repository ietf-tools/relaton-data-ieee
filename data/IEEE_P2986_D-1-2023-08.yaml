abstract:
- content: 'Privacy and security issues pose great challenges to the federated machine
    leaning community. A general view on privacy and security risks while meeting
    applicable privacy and security requirements in federated machine learning is
    provided. A recommended practice is provided in four parts: malicious failure
    and non-malicious failure in federated machine learning, privacy and security
    requirements from the perspective of system and federated machine learning participants,
    defensive methods and fault recovery methods and the privacy and security risks
    evaluation. It also provides some guidance for typical federated learning scenarios
    in different industry areas which can facilitate practitioners to use federal
    learning in a better way.'
