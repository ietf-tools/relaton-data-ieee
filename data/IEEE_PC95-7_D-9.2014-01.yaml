abstract:
- content: IEEE C95.7-1 20XX describes elements of a radio frequency (RF) exposure
    safety program that provide reasonable and adequate guidance for preventing exposures
    in excess of recognized limits to electromagnetic fields from RF sources that
    operate in the frequency range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz. The means for accomplishing
    this are classifying exposure locations into one of four categories based on the
    potential hazard, as defined by exposure limits, and specifying appropriate controls
    for each category. Such controls include engineering and administrative controls
    as well as the use of personal protective equipment, placement of appropriate
    RF safety signage, designation of restricted access areas, the use of personal
    RF monitors and RF safety awareness training. These recommendations are not intended
    to apply to the purposeful exposure of patients by or under the direction of medical
    practitioners, but can be used in the development of safety programs for medical
    staff and other persons working with or incidentally exposed to RF fields, and
    for those wearing implanted or external medical electronic devices. Although designed
    to complement IEEE Std C95.1, this recommended practice may also be used for the
    development of programs to insure conformance with other guidelines, standards,
    or regulations for controlling human exposure to electromagnetic energy as well
    as IEEE Std C95.6 in which case, appropriate modifications will be necessary to
    address the low frequency region addressed by IEEE Std C95.6.
