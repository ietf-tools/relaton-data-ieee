abstract:
- content: This project develops a set of common functionality for the family of IEEE
    P1451 smart transducer interface standards. This functionality is independent
    of the physical communications media. It includes the basic functions required
    to control and manage smart transducers, common communications protocols, and
    media-independent Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) formats. It defines
    a set of implementation-independent application programming interfaces (API).
    This project does not specify signal conditioning and conversion, physical media,
    or how the TEDS data are used in applications.
