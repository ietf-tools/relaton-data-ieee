abstract:
- content: A procedure for naming time sequence data (TSD) files, such as files produced
    by digital fault recorders, power swing recorders, power quality monitors, and
    so on is recommended. The sources of TSD files are described, and a survey of
    current naming techniques is provided. The advantages of using a common naming
    procedure are highlighted, and the limitations and applications are identified.
    Issues of compatibility across operating systems and various vintages, and adaptability
    to other types of files are also discussed. The required and optional portions
    of the naming procedure are described in detail, and many examples are provided.
