abstract:
- content: 'Data has become one of the most important assets in ICT area. Secure Multi-Party
    Computation plays a very important role in balancing data usage and data protection.
    It could build trust and security in data collaboration and big data analysis
    related areas. This standard provides a technical framework for Secure Multi-Party
    Computation, including 4 specifying: --An overview of Secure Multi-Party Computation
    --A technical framework of Secure Multi-Party Computation --Security levels of
    Secure Multi-Party Computation --Use cases based on Secure Multi-Party Computation'
