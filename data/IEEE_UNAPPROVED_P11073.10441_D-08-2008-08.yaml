abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of communication
    between personal telehealth cardiovascular fitness and activity monitor devices
    and compute engines (e.g. cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances,
    set top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages
    appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology,
    information models, application profile standards, and transport standards. It
    specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth
    environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability.
    This standard defines a common core of communication functionality for personal
    telehealth cardiovascular fitness and activity monitor devices.
