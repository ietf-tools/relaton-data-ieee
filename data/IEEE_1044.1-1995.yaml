- content: Administratively withdrawn This guide provides supporting information to
    assist users applying the IEEE Std 1044-1993, IEEE Standard Classification for
    Software Anomalies to decide whether to conform completely or just extract ideas
    from that standard. This guide will enable users of IEEE Std 1044-1993 to implement
    and customize IEEE Std 1044-1993 for their organization in an effective and efficient
    manner.
