abstract:
- content: Although the storage battery is of primary importance in assuring the satisfactory
    operation of generating stations and substations, no single up-to-date guide exists
    to aid engineers in sizing the battery for a particular installation. This Recommended
    Practice is based on commonly accepted methods used to define the load and to
    ensure adequate battery capacity. The method described is applicable to all installations
    and battery sizes. The installations considered herein are designed for "full
    float" operation with a battery charger serving to maintain the battery in a charged
    condition as well as to supply the normal dc load.
