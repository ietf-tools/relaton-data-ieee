abstract:
- content: 'Electrical distribution systems in cement plants that would result in
    satisfactory equipment utilization, reliability, performance, safety, and low
    maintenance-all at a reasonable cost are recommended in this IEEE standard. Power
    distribution for a new plant and for a plant extension are covered, as is distribution
    in quarries. Remarks: Superseded by IEEE Std 277-2007'
