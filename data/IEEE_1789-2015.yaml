abstract:
- content: This document includes a definition of the concept of modulation frequencies
    for light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a discussion on their applications to LED lighting,
    a description of LED lighting applications in which modulation frequencies pose
    possible health risks to users, a discussion of the dimming of LEDs by modulating
    the frequency of driving currents/voltage, and recommendations for modulation
    frequencies (flicker) for LED lighting and dimming applications to help protect
    against known potential adverse health effects.
