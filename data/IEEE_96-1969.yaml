abstract:
- content: 'This standard establishes general principles for rating electric apparatus
    for short-time, intermittent, or varying duty. The four methods used for rating
    equipment are covered by the standard: the continuous rating method; the continuous
    plus short-time overload rating method or nominal rating method; the short-time
    rating method; and the periodic rating method.'
