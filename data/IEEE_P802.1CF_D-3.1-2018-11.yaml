abstract:
- content: An access network (which connects terminals to their access routers) utilizing
    technologies based on the family of IEEE 802&#174; standards is specified in this
    recommended practice. An access network reference model (NRM) that includes entities
    and reference points along with behavioral and functional descriptions of communications
    among those entities is provided in this recommended practice.
