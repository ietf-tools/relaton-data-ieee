abstract:
- content: This standard applies to interface systems used to interconnect both programmable
    and nonprogrammable electronic measuring apparatus with other apparatus and accessories
    necessary to assemble instrumentation systems. It applies to the interface of
    instrumentation systems, or portions of them, in which the a) Data exchanged among
    the interconnected apparatus is digital (as distinct from analog); b) Number of
    devices that may be interconnected by one contiguous bus does not exceed 15; c)
    Total transmission path lengths over the interconnecting cables does not exceed
    20 m; d) Data rate among devices does not exceed 8 000 000 B/s. The basic functional
    specifications of this standard may be used in digital interface applications
    that require longer distances, more devices, increased noise immunity, or combinations
    of these. Different electrical and mechanical specifications may be required (for
    example, symmetrical circuit configurations, high threshold logic, special connectors,
    or cable configurations) for these extended applications.
