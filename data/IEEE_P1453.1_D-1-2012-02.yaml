abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 61000-3-7:2008 is adopted by this standard. This part of IEC 61000
    provides guidance on principles which can be used as the basis for determining
    the requirements for the connection of fluctuating installations to MV, HV and
    EHV public power systems (LV installations are covered in other IEC documents).
    For the purposes of this report, a fluctuating installation means an installation
    (which may be a load or a generator) that produces voltage flicker and/or rapid
    voltage changes. The primary objective is to provide guidance to system operators
    or owners on engineering practices which will facilitate the provision of adequate
    service quality for all connected customers. In addressing installations, this
    document is not intended to replace equipment standards for emission limits.
