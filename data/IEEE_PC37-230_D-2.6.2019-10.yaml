abstract:
  content: A review of generally accepted applications and coordination of protection
    for power system distribution lines is presented. The advantages and disadvantages
    of schemes presently being used in protecting distribution lines are examined
    in this guide. Identification of problems with the methods used in distribution
    line protection and the solutions for those problems is included.
