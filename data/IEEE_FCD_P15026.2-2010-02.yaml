abstract:
- content: This International Standard specifies minimum requirements for the structure
    and contents of an assurance case. An assurance case includes a top-level claim
    for a property of a system or product (or set of claims), systematic argumentation
    regarding this claim, and the evidence and explicit assumptions that underlie
    this argumentation. Arguing through multiple levels of subordinate claims, this
    structured argumentation connects the top-level claim to the evidence and assumptions.
