abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, a normative definition of communication is established in this
    standard between personal telehealth peak expiratory flow monitor devices and
    compute engines (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances,
    and set-top boxes) in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability. Appropriate
    portions of existing standards are leveraged, including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology,
    information models, application profile standards, and transport standards. The
    use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors is specified in telehealth
    environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability.
    A common core of communication functionality is defined for personal telehealth
    peak expiratory flow monitor devices.
