abstract:
- content: Specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution class enclosed
    single-pole air switches and associated accessories with rated voltages from 1
    kV through 8.3 kV are established. All of these devices are intended for use on
    alternating current distribution systems. These include distribution class enclosed
    single-pole air switches, supports, mountings, fuse hooks, and tongs, all of the
    type used exclusively with distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches,
    and distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches used in enclosure packages.
