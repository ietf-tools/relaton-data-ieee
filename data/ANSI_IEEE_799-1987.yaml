abstract:
- content: This guide applies only to the United States and its territories. Electrical
    equipment manufacturers, owners, operators, and maintenance personnel who utilize
    polychlorinated biphenyls or conduct maintenance or manufacturing operations through
    which these can be encountered are subject to the new regulations. There are requirements
    for identification, labeling, and servicing equipment, and handling and disposal
    of equipment and materials. There are also requirements for handling spills and
    leaks and for keeping comprehensive records. The specific purpose of this guide
    is to cover in detail the procedures for handling askarels and mineral insulating
    oil that contain PCBs, and to describe the analytical procedures for measuring
    them.<<ETX>>
