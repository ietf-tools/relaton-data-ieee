abstract:
- content: This guide describes significant aspects of handling SF6 gas used in electric
    power equipment such as gas recovery, reclamation, recycling in order to keep
    the gas permanently in a closed cycle and avoiding any deliberate release in environment.
    The purpose is to provide stateof- the-art technologies and procedures to minimize
    SF6 gas emission to a minimum functional level for the electric power equipment
    to preserve the environment. This Guide will include all the aspects for consideration
    during commissioning and re-commissioning, topping up, refilling, checking the
    gas quality at site, sampling and shipment for off-site gas analysis, recovering
    and reclaiming during normal operation and at the end of the life of power equipment
    while dismantling. This Guide also presents the state-of-the art tools and measuring
    devices including the necessary personnel protective equipment. The basis for
    the preparation of this Guide is CIGRE Brochure No. 276 Guide for preparation
    of Customised "Practical SF6 Handling Instructions", August 2005 edition, which
    was developed by the Study Committee B3, Task Force B3.02.01.
