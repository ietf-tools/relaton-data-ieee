abstract:
- content: This standard applies to measuring transducers used for converting AC electrical
    quantities such as current, voltage, power (active or reactive), power factor,
    phase angle or frequency to direct current or voltage. Within the effective range,
    a change of output is a function of the corresponding change of input that produces
    it. An auxiliary supply may be needed to power active circuitry.
