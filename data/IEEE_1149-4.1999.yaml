abstract:
- content: '" The testability structure for digital circuits described in IEEE Std
    1149.1-1990 has beenextended to provide similar facilities for mixed-signal circuits.
    The architecture is described, togetherwith the means of control of and access
    to both analog and digital test data. Sample implementationand application details
    (which are not part of the standard) are included for illustration. "'
