- content: 'Conformance tests and requirements for the coating integrity of carbon
    steel pole-mounted enclosures containing apparatus energized in excess of 600
    V, and not for application in coastal or other severe environments, are specified
    in this standard. These enclosures are typically located out of reach of the general
    public, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of equipment
    enclosures: pole-mounted distribution transformers, pole-mounted switches, pole-mounted
    regulators, pole-mounted metering equipment, pole-mounted reclosers, and pole-mounted
    switchgear.'
