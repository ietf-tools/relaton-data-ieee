abstract:
- content: 'This guide applies to reliability data of electrical, electronic, sensing
    component, and mechanical equipment. It is intended to establish one method of
    collecting and presenting reliability data for use in nuclear-power generating
    station reliability calculations as outlined in IEEE Std 352-1975, IEEE Guide
    for General Principles of Reliability Analysis of Nuclear-Power Generating Station
    Protection Systems. The data contained in Appendix D are intended for the use
    of either nuclear systems reliability analysts or design engineers. '
