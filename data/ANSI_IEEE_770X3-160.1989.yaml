abstract:
  content: The standard provides an unambiguous and machine-independent definition
    of the computer programming language Extended Pascal by specifying requirements
    for a processor and for a conforming program. Its purpose is to facilitate portability
    of Extended Pascal programs for use on a wide variety of data processing systems.
    Two levels of compliance are defined for both processors and programs.
