abstract:
- content: A key concept and requirement for an operational and effective deployment
    of a large number of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) which include sources
    of power and demand response, to enable the provision of flexibility and grid
    services is the aggregation of DER. A DER Management System (DERMS) provides this
    aggregation function, as well as the functions required to enable grid services.
    This guide provides a functional specification for a DERMS and describes the grid
    services that aggregated DER can provide the distribution and transmission systems.
    It addresses implementation issues and discusses the interoperability requirements
    of a DERMS with its environment, including the transmission and distribution systems,
    and the communication and information infrastructure of modern grids.
