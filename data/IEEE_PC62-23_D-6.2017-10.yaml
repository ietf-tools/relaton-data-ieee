abstract:
- content: This guide consolidates most electric utility power industry practices,
    accepted theories, existing standards/guides, definitions, and technical references
    as they specifically pertain to surge protection of electric power generating
    plants. Where technical information is not readily available, guidance is provided
    to aid toward proper surge protection and to reduce interference to communication,
    control, and protection circuits due to surges and other overvoltages. It has
    to be recognized that this application guide approaches the subject of surge protection
    from a common or generalized application viewpoint. Complex applications of surge
    protection practices may require specialized study by experienced engineers.
