abstract:
- content: The following "Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas" is a cemprehensive
    revision of the 1948 "Definitions of Terms." It also supersedes the definitions
    contained in the 1965 "Test Procedure," although the changes in those definitions
    are few and relatively minor. As this work reached completion, the Antennas and
    Waveguides Committee divided into two separate committees, one on antennas and
    one on waveguides. These are now incorporated into the structures of the IEEE
    Group on Antennas and Propagation and the IEEE Group on Microwave Theory and Techniques,
    respectively. In general, the definitions assume that the antenna is not located
    in a medium such as a plasma, salt water, or the earth. In such cases, careful
    evaluation may be necessary to determine whether the term is applicable and how
    it can be properly employed. For terms that are quantitative it is understood
    that frequency must be specified. Those terms in which phase or polarization is
    a significant part of the definition imply a coherent source of power. Whenever
    a term is commonly used in other fields but has specialized significance in the
    field of antennas, this is noted in the title.
