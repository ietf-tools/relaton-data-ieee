abstract:
- content: Electrification is the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century
    and power systems have been serving as the crucial infrastructure for societal
    and economic functioning. A paradigm shift is underway, transitioning from centralized
    generation with synchronous machines to distributed generation interfaced with
    power electronic converters. An increasing number of loads are interfaced with
    power electronic converters as well. Moreover, electrification is still ongoing
    - over a billion people still lack electricity access and those who do still have
    limited freedom to choose reliable suppliers. The rise of renewable distributed
    energy resources (DER), like wind and solar power, offers an affordable solution
    and expedites the shift. This shift, termed the democratization of power systems,
    presents unprecedented challenges to grid stability and reliability. Turning power
    electronic converters into Virtual Synchronous Machines (VSM) to mimic and, in
    some cases, to surpass the dynamics and behavior of conventional synchronous machines
    through the inherent synchronization mechanism of synchronous machines is a promising
    solution to unify and harmonize their interface and interaction with each other
    and the grid. This standard defines fundamental principles, mandatory functions,
    and optional functions of a Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM) to make power electronic
    converters standardized for different applications and suitable for single-unit
    operation, multi-unit operation, islanded/off-grid operation, and grid-tied operation,
    facilitating the large-scale utilization of DER and the integration of power electronic
    converters into the grid, and advancing energy freedom and energy access.
