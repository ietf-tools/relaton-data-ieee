abstract:
- content: Superseded by IEEE Std 421.5-2005. Excitation system models suitable for
    use in large scale system stability studies are presented. With these models,
    most of the excitation systems currently in widespread use on large, system-connected
    synchronous machines in North America can be represented. They include updates
    of models published in the IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems in
    1981 as well as models for additional control features such as discontinuous excitation
    controls.
