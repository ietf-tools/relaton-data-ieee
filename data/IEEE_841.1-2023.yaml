abstract:
- content: 'International Energy Efficiency Class 3 (IE3) (premium-efficiency) totally
    enclosed fan cooled (TEFC) International Cooling IC411, totally enclosed air over
    (TEAO) IC418 and totally enclosed non-ventilated (TENV) IC410, horizontal and
    vertical, single-speed, squirrel cage polyphase induction motors, 0.75 kW to 370
    kW (1 hp to 500 hp), and up to 4000 V, in International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC) frame sizes (80) and larger, for severe-duty applications seen in the Process
    Industry (commonly referred to as IE3 (premium-efficiency) severe-duty motors)
    are applied in this standard. Excluded from the scope of this standard are motors
    with sleeve bearings, totally enclosed blower-cooled (TEBC) IC416, and additional
    specific features required for flameproof motors. Note-additional downloads available
