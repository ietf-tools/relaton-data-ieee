- content: "(Revision of IEEE Std 187-1990) Abstract: Spurious radiation from sound
    and television broadcast receivers of the superheterodyne type are possible sources
    of interference with other radio services. This standard describes the potential
    sources of spurious radiation from receivers intended for the reception of sound
    and television broadcast, and the measurement methods for them."
