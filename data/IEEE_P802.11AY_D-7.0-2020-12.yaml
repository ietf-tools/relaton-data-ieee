abstract:
- content: In this amendment to IEEE Std 802.11-2020, standardized modifications to
    both the IEEE 802.11 physical layer (PHY) and the IEEE 802.11 medium access control
    (MAC) sublayer are defined to enable at least one mode of operation capable of
    supporting a maximum throughput of at least 20 gigabits per second (measured at
    the MAC data service access point), while maintaining or improving the power efficiency
    per station.
