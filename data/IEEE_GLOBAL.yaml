abstract:
- content: One of the primary goals of smart grid is to provide its consumers control
    over their energy consumption, with the help of real-time information, which in
    turn benefits both consumers and utilities in managing electricity. This report
    details the challenges faced by utilities, government bodies and industry bodies
    in understanding the consumer behavior and educating them on smart grid. It also
    suggests action items that can be undertaken in order to create large-scale awareness
    and understanding among consumers.The report highlights the role of a consumer
    in successful smart grid deployment. It segregates consumers into various strata
    on the basis of attributes such as their requirements and priorities, smart grid
    technologies and services from which they will benefit most, and the methods of
    engaging with them. It also details out the key challenges faced by consumers
    in adopting smart grid services. These challenges have become a formidable roadblock
    in the smooth implementation of smart grids. The report also throws light on various
    expectations that consumers have from smart grids and suggests key socialization
    channels for mitigating concerns and delivering value to consumers. For Corporate
