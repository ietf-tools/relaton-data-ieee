abstract:
- content: 'This standard represents a merger of two previous standards: IEEE Std
    1364-2005 Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and IEEE Std 1800-2005 SystemVerilog
    unifiedhardware design, specification, and verification language. The 2005 SystemVerilog
    standard defines extensions to the 2005 Verilog standard. These two standards
    were designed to be usedas one language. Merging the base Verilog language and
    the SystemVerilog extensions into a single standard provides users with all information
    regarding syntax and semantics in a singledocument.'
