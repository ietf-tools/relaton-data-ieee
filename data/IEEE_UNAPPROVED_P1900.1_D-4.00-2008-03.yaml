abstract:
- content: This standard provides technically precise definitions and explanations
    of key concepts in the fields of spectrum management, cognitive radio, policy
    defined radio, adaptive radio, software defined radio, and related technologies.
    The document goes beyond simple, short definitions by providing amplifying text
    that explains these technologies. The document also describe how these technologies
    interrelate and create new capabilities while at the same time providing mechanisms
    supportive of new spectrum management paradigms such as dynamic spectrum access.
