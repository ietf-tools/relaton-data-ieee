abstract:
- content: 'This standard covers enclosed low-voltage AC power circuit breakers, as
    follows: (1) stationary or draw-out type of two or three-pole construction, with
    one or more rated maximum voltages of 635 V (600 V for units incorporating fuses),
    508 V, and 254 V for application on systems having nominal voltages of 600 V,
    480 V, and 240 V. (2) unfused circuit breakers and fused circuit breakers (3)
    manually operated or power operated circuit breakers, with or without electromechanical
    or solid state trip devices.<<ETX>>'
