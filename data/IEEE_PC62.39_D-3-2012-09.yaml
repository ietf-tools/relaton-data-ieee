abstract:
- content: This standard gives the basic requirements to be met by series connected,
    solid-state, self-restoring overcurrent protectors (OCPs) for the protection of
    telecommunication equipment and lines. This standard should be used for the harmonization
    of existing or future specifications issued by solid-state, self-restoring overcurrent
    protector manufacturers, telecommunication equipment manufacturers, administrations
    or network operators.
