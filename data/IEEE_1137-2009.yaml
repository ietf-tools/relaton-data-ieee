abstract:
- content: IEEE Std 1137trade-1991 provides guidance for controlling or modifying
    the inductive environment and the susceptibility of affected wire line telecommunications
    facilities in order to operate within the acceptable levels of steady-state or
    surge induced voltages of the environmental interface (probe wire) defined by
    IEEE Std 776trade-1987. Procedures for determining the source of the problem are
    given. Mitigation theory and philosophy are discussed, and mitigation devices
    are described. The application of typical mitigation apparatus is addressed. Advice
    for determining the best engineering solution is offered, and general safety considerations
    are discussed.
