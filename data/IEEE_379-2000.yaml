abstract:
- content: Application of the single-failure criterion to the electrical power, instrumentation,
    and control portions of nuclear power generating station safety systems is covered.
    Conformance with the requirements of IEEE Std 603-1991 and the single-failure
    criterion as stated in that document is established. Interpretation and guidance
    in the application of the single-failure criterion, a discussion of the failures,
    and an acceptable method of single-failure analysis are presented.
