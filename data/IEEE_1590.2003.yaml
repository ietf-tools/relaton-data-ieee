abstract:
- content: The main emphasis of this recommended practice is the engineering design
    of optical fiber communication facilities serving, or connected to, electrical
    supply locations. This document includes methods for providing telecommunication
    facilities serving electrical supply locations using optical fiber cables extending
    across the zone of influence (ZOI)

- content: 'This Recommended Practice presents engineering design procedures for the
    electrical protection of optical fiber communication facilities serving, or connected
    to, electric supply locations. Other telecommunication alternatives, such as radio
    and cable with metallic members are excluded from this document. Project purpose:
    This Recommended Practice presents safe and reliable methods for providing telecommunication
    facilities serving electrical supply locations using optical fiber.'
