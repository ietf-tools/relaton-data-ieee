abstract:
- content: The scope of this guide covers the application of surge protective devices
    for the electrical equipment and systems with voltages of 1000 V (ac) and 1500
    V (dc) or less within a smart grid. This includes power, communications, control
    systems, data acquisition equipment and associated circuitry. Additionally, there
    are cases which involve smart grid equipment attaching or coupling to higher voltage
    circuits such as electric utility medium voltage distribution. This scope does
    not limit providing guidance for such matters.
