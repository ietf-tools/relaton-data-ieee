abstract:
- content: This standard specifies a radio interface including medium access control
    sublayer and physical layer of white space dynamic spectrum access radio systems
    supporting fixed and mobile operation in white space frequency bands, while avoiding
    causing harmful interference to incumbent users in these frequency bands.
