abstract:
- content: 'Methods are established for performance testing, calibration, and use
    of sodium iodide detector systems for the measurement of gamma-ray emission rates
    of radionuclides, assay for radioactivity, and the determination of gamma-ray
    energies. Both energy calibration and efficiency calibration are covered. Three
    techniques are considered: total spectrum counting, which employs a system that
    counts all events above a low-energy threshold; single-channel analyzer counting,
    which employs a system with a counting window that establishes upper and lower
    energy boundaries; and multichannel analyzer counting, which employs a system
    utilizing multiple counting windows.'
