abstract:
- content: This standard applies to organizations that conduct qualification tests
    on equipment that has a definable safety function and is an identifiable part
    of a safety system for use in nuclear power generating stations. It requires a
    technical program, a quality assurance program, and a demonstrated ability to
    meet specified technical requirements. It does not apply to materials tests, production
    tests, normal performance testing, qualification by analysis, qualification by
    operating experience, or reliability tests such as diesel-generator multiple start
    tests.
