abstract:
  content: Superseded by 400-1991. This guide lists the various field test methods
    that are currently available or under development with guidance on how to perform
    each test. The guide covers shielded, insulated power cable systems rated 5 kV
    through 500 kV unless these voltages are modified by the specific “point” document.
