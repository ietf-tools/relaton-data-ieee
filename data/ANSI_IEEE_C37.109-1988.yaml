abstract:
- content: This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations
    and Protective Relays. This standard discusses the protection of shunt reactors
    used typically to compensate for capacitive shunt reactance of transmission lines.
    The more common circuit arrangements and protective relaying schemes presently
    in use are discussed and illustrated.
