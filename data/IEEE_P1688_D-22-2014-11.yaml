abstract:
- content: 'This standard is for use in the specification of electromagnetic performance
    requirements for Replaceable Electronic Modules (REMs). This standard is suitable
    for items that have the following features: removable/replaceable electronic circuit
    modules that plug into an equipment rack or frame, with electrical interconnections
    primarily through edge connectors that interfaces directly with a backplane, and
    electrical power input derived from the backplane power sources. This standard
    is based on MIL-STD-461 System/Equipment level EMI controls. The conducted and
    radiated requirements, limits and test methods were adapted to provide risk reduction
    of REM EMI before integration in a system/equipment.'
