abstract:
- content: Vented lead-acid (VLA), valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), and nickel-cadmium
    (NiCd) stationary battery installations are discussed in this guide, written to
    serve as a bridge between the electrical designer and the heating, ventilation,
    and air-conditioning (HVAC) designer. Ventilation of stationary battery installations
    is critical to improving battery life while reducing the hazards associated with
    hydrogen production. This guide describes battery operating modes and the hazards
    associated with each. It provides the HVAC designer with the information to provide
    a cost effective ventilation solution.
