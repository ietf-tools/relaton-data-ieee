abstract:
- content: This standard provides requirements for the test and review of software
    user documentation as part of the life cycle processes. It defines the documentation
    process from the viewpoint of the documentation tester and reviewer. It specifies
    process for use in testing and reviewing of user documentation, and provides the
    minimum requirements for these activities. It is relevant to roles involved in
    testing and development of software and user documentation, including project
    managers, usability experts and information developers, in addition to testers
    and reviewers. It applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation,
    and is applicable to user documentation for systems including hardware.
