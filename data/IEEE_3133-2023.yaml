abstract:
- content: Direct-current (dc) ice-melting conditions, melting current, melting duration,
    and the amplitude of harmonics injected into the power grid are specified in this
    guide to support the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of dc ice melting.
    The technical parameters, inspection, operation, and maintenance of dc ice-melting
    devices are also specified. The purpose of this guide is to provide dc ice-melting
    methods, which can be used to help prevent collapse of power transmission towers
    as well as disconnection and outage of transmission lines under continuous snow
    and freezing rain.
