abstract:
- content: Signs and symbols used in writing mathematical text are defined. Special
    symbols peculiar to certain branches of mathematics, such as non-Euclidean Geometries,
    Abstract Algebras, Topology, and Mathematics of Finance, which are not ordinarily
    applied to the physical sciences and engineering, are omitted.
