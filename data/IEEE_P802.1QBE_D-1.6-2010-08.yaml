abstract:
- content: This standard specifies protocols, procedures, and managed objects to support
    topology change signaling to alter the binding (held in an I-Component) of Customer
    addresses to Backbone addresses on a per-I-SID basis. This is accomplished by
    extending the use of the Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP).
