abstract:
- content: A message exchange framework based on information elements as a transport
    method for key management protocol (KMP) datagrams and guidelines for the use
    of some existing KMPs with IEEE Std 802.15.4 are defined in the recommended practice.
    A new KMP is not created in this recommended practice. In support of KMP transmission
    and reception, a generic multiplexed data service layer that can be used to transmit
    large packets from the upper KMP to another peer is also provided in this recommended
    practice. The multiplexed data service provides a fragmentation and multiplexing
    layer for those packets so they can be delivered over smaller MAC layer frames
    and multiplexed on the recipient end to the right processing service.
