abstract:
- content: 'This procedure is intended for form-wound bars/coils for rotating machines
    rated 10 kV or more at 50 Hz or 60 Hz that are subjected to many transitions from
    no-load to full-load current during normal operations, and where rapid load variations
    are typical. Only the thermal cyclic degradation within the groundwall insulation
    and/or the conductor package and delamination of the groundwall insulation from
    the conductor are addressed by this test. The procedure is applicable to indirectly-cooled
    machine types such as: -- combustion turbine generators -- pumped storage or peaking
    duty hydrogenerators -- synchronous condensers -- cyclic duty water pump motors
    Various pass/fail criteria are presented, and the ones that apply in a specific
    circumstance must be agreed between user and manufacturer prior to commencement
    of testing'
