abstract:
- content: Methods, techniques, and designs to mitigate bird-related power interruptions
    and equipment damage resulting from avian interactions with electric facilities
    are covered in this document. This document addresses electrocutions, collisions,
    nesting problems, and outages caused by fecal contamination and fecal streamers.
    The topics include bird impacts to transmission lines, distribution lines, and
    substations. Woodpecker issues are also addressed. It is believed that resolving
    these issues will improve system reliability and minimize revenue losses.
