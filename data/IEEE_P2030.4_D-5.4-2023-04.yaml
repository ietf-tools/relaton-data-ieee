abstract:
- content: 'This guide applies the smart grid interoperability reference model (SGIRM)
    developed in IEEE Std 2030-2011 to systems that integrated distributed energy
    resources (DER) such as DER management systems (DERMS). In the process of applying
    the SGIRM-2011, elements were added to reflect the changes that have occurred
    since 2011 in electric grids. These include the increasing deployment of DER both
    at the distribution system and, when aggregated, at the transmission system, and
    the increasing role of electricity markets, and business and environmental considerations
    in their deployment. These elements were added to the SGIRM. The SGIRM defines
    three integrated architectural perspectives (IAP): power systems, communications
    and information technology, and business and regulatory requirements. The SGIRM
    facilitates the implementation of interoperability requirements by establishing
    relationships between elements of the complete installation, regrouped within
    IAPs, and by identifying the relevant and applicable standards and rules. The
    SGIRM can be used to complement design approaches for individual elements of a
    system, and facilitates extensibility, scalability, and upgradeability.'
