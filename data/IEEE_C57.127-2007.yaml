abstract:
- content: The detection and location of acoustic emissions from partial discharges
    and other sources in oil immersed power transformers and reactors are covered
    in this guide. A means of associating the relative magnitude and position of partial
    discharges and other sources with the acoustic signals obtained by strategically
    located transducers is provided.
