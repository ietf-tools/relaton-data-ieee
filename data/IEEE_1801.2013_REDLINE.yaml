abstract:
  content: A method is provided for specifying power intent for an electronic design,
    for use in verification of the structure and behavior of the design in the context
    of a given power management architecture, and for driving implementation of that
    power management architecture. The method supports incremental refinement of power
    intent specifications required for IP-based design flows. (Thanks to our sponsor,
    the PDF of this standard is provided to the public no charge. Visit http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/index.html
    for more details.)
