abstract:
- content: 'This International Standard provides a set of tools with which to implement
    a Futurebus+ architecture with performance and cost scalability over time, for
    multiple generations of single- and multiple-bus multiprocessor systems. Although
    this specification is principally intended for 64-bit address and data operation,
    a fully compatible 32-bit subset is provided, along with compatible extensions
    to support 128- and 256-bit data highways. Allocation of bus bandwidth to competing
    modules is provided by either a fast centralized arbiter, or a fully distributed,
    one or two pass, parallel contention arbiter. Bus allocation rules are provided
    to suit the needs of both real-time (priority based) and fairness (equal opportunity
    access based) configurations. Transmission of data over the multiplexed address/data
    highway is governed by one of two intercompatible transmission methods: a) a technology-independent,
    compelled-protocol, supporting broadcast, broad call, and transfer intervention
    (the minimum requirement for all Futurebus+ systems), and b) a configurable transfer-rate,
    source-synchronized protocol supporting only block transfers and source-synchronized
    broadcast for systems requiring the highest possible performance. Futurebus+ takes
    its name from its goal of being capable of the highest possible transfer rate
    consistent with the technology available at the time modules are designed, while
    ensuring compatibility with all modules designed to this standard both before
    and after. The plus sign (+) refers to the extensible nature of the specification,
    and the hooks provided to allow further evolution to meet unanticipated needs
    of specific application architectures. It is intended that this International
    Standard be used as a key component of an approved IEEE Futurebus+ profile.'
