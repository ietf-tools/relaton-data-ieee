abstract:
- content: 'The standard specifies extensions to high-level languages for microprocessor
    applications. It covers computer languages for which there exist either ANSI or
    IEEE standards, or draft standards in preparation by existing ANSI or IEEE committees.
    Notwithstanding the extensions herein provided, the language extended by this
    standard shall conform to the existing standard for that language. This standard
    explicitly extends three languages: Basic, Fortran, and Pascal. Other languages
    may be implicitly extended by the consistent application of the naming conventions
    and rules for extension specified in this standard.<<ETX>>'
