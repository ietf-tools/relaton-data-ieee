abstract:
- content: The intent of this standard is to name a common set of instructions used
    by most general purpose microprocessors, to provide rules for the naming of new
    instructions and the derivation of new mnemonics, and to establish assembly language
    conventions and syntax. It is intended to be used as a basis for microprocessor
    assembler specification. This standard sets forth the functional definitions and
    corresponding mnemonics for microprocessor instructions. The specific set of instructions
    differs for each type of processor. Likewise, the number of condition codes and
    their setting and resetting is processor-dependent, and is not prescribed by this
    standard. Each use of a particular microprocessor should be thoroughly conversant
    with its operation and should make no a priori assumptions with regard to the
    detailed behavior of its instructions.<<ETX>>
