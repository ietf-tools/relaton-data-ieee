abstract:
- content: This amendment enhances the 802.20 Management Information Base (MIB) chapter
    to include additional information and MIB documentation (i.e, a discussion of
    Security impacts, and cross references to the text for appropriate parameters
    within the MIB, itself) to conform with the applicable parts of the IETF's 2008
    guidelines for MIBs. The amendment also corrects any errors, inconsistencies and
    ambiguities associated with the MIB chapter of IEEE 802.20-2008.
