abstract:
- content: This is a guide describing the surge voltage, surge current, and temporary
    overvoltages(TOV) environment in low-voltage [up to 1000 V root mean square (rms)]
    ac power circuits. This scope does not include other power disturbances, such
    as notches, sags, and noise. This IEEE standards product is part C62 Family on
    Surge Protection.
