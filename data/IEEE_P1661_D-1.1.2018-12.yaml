abstract:
- content: This guide is specifically prepared for a PV/engine generator hybrid power
    system, but may also be applicable to all hybrid power systems where there is
    at least one renewable power source, such as PV, and a dispatchable power source,
    such as an engine generator. Taper-charge parameters for PV hybrid systems are
    suggested to help in preparing the battery for a capacity test. A test procedure
    is provided to ensure appropriate data acquisition, battery characterization,
    and capacity measurements. Finally, a process to review test results and make
    appropriate decisions regarding the battery is provided. No cycle-life predictions
    are made.
