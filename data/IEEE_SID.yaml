abstract:
- content: This application guide for capacitance current switching applies to ac
    high-voltage circuit breakers rated in accordance with American National Standard
    Requirements for Capacitance Current Switching for AC HighVoltage Circuit Breakers,
    C37.073-1972. It is intended to supplement the American National Standard Application
    Guide for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.010-1972 (IEEE Std 320-1972),
    and specifically, to enlarge on Section 4.14.3, Capacitor Switching, and Section
    4.14.4, Line Charging Switching. Circuit breakers rated and manufactured to meet
    other standards should be applied in accordance with application procedures adapted
    to their specific ratings.
