- content: The data format that shall be used for both required and optional data
    to be made available by radiation measurement instruments for homeland security
    applications is specified. The performance for these types of instruments is described
    in other standards; such as ANSI N42.32, ANSI N42.33, ANSI N42.34, ANSI N42.35,
    ANSI N42.38, ANSI N42.43, ANSI N42.48, ANSI N42.49A, and ANSI N42.53. (The PDF
    of this standard is available at no cost compliments of Department of Homeland
    Security Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.
