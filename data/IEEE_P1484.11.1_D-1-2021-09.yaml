abstract:
- content: This Standard describes a data model to support the interchange of data
    elements and their values between a content object and a runtime service (RTS).
    It is based on a current industry practice called “CMI&#8212;Computer Managed
    Instruction.” The work upon which this Standard is based was developed to support
    a client/server environment in which a learning technology system, generically
    called a learning management system (LMS), de-livers digital content, called content
    objects, to learners. The data model supports learner data and preferences, interactions,
    objectives, content-object entry, exit, and status information, time parameters,
    and scores.
