abstract:
- content: Utilities face challenges in conducting measurement and verification in
    CVR deployed feeders. A standard is needed to provide procedures for electric
    utilities to determine the value of their CVR programs, define parameters for
    regulatory reporting, and define standardized verification methodology selection
    based on standard data collection methodologies. The purpose of this standard
    is to specify CVR data management and collection procedures for use by the electric
    utility industry to enable improved system operation.The stakeholders for this
    standard include Electric utilities, Electric utility equipment manufacturers,
    Software vendors, and Electric utility regulatory commissions.
