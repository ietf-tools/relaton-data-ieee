abstract:
- content: This draft standard defines the medium access control characteristics,
    physical layerinterface methods and layer management parameters for the resilient
    packet ring (RPR) accessmethod for ring topologies. A set of protocols for detecting
    and initializing the shared ring configuration,recovering from failures, and regulating
    fair access to the shared medium are alsodescribed. Specifications are provided
    for interface to a number of physical layers, supporting datarates up to 10 Gb/s.
    System considerations and management information base (MIB) specificationsare
    also provided in this standard.
