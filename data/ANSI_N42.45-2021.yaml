abstract:
- content: Standard test methods for the evaluation of image quality of computed tomography
    security-screening systems are established in this document. The quality of data
    for automated analysis is the primary concern. The system’s ability to use this
    image data to automatically detect explosives or other threat materials, which
    is typically verified by an appropriate regulatory body, is not addressed in this
    standard.
