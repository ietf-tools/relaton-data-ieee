abstract:
- content: Defined in this standard is a reference architecture required for building
    a virtual reality (VR) training system for large space disaster response. The
    system using this architecture simulates responses to a disaster that can occur
    in a large-scale physical space by applying VR technology. The scope of this standard
    includes architecture, requirements, and system designs for VR disaster response
    training systems.
