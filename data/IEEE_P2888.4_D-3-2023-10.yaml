abstract:
- content: 'This standard defines a reference architecture required for building a
    virtual reality training system for large space disaster response. The system
    using this architecture simulates responses to a disaster that can occur in a
    large-scale physical space by applying virtual reality technology. The scope of
    this standard includes: - architecture, - requirements, and - system designs for
    VR disaster response training system.'
