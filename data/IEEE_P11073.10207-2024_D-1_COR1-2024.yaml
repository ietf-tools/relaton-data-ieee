abstract:
- content: The IEEE 11073-10207-2017 standard falls within the context of the ISO/IEEE
    11073&#8482; family of standards for point-of-care medical device communication.
    In this standard, a Participant Model is derived from the ISO/IEEE 11073-10201
    Domain Information Model. The Participant Model specifies the structure of medical
    information objects. Additionally, the standard defines an 4 abstract Communication
    Model to facilitate the exchange of medical information objects. Both the Participant
    Model and Communication Model elements are specified using XML Schema. The core
    subjects covered by the Participant Model include the modeling of medical device-related
    7 data (such as measurements and settings), alert systems, contextual information
    (such as patient demographics and location), remote control, and archival information.
    XML Schema is utilized to provide extensibility to the model. The corrigendum
    for this standard comprises fixes related to definition terms, requirements, and
    a significant retrofit of the versioning concept. It ensures that the standard
    remains accurate and up-to-date, addressing any issues that may have arisen since
    its initial publication.
