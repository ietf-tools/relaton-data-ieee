- content: Methods for determining antenna factors of antennas used for radiated emission
    measurements of electromagnetic interference (EMI) from 9 kHz to 40 GHz are provided.
    Antennas included are linearly polarized antennas such as loops, rods (monopoles),
    tuned dipoles, biconicaldipoles, log-periodic dipole arrays, broadband horns,
    etc., which are used in measurements governed by ANSI C63.4-1992. The methods
    include standard site (i.e., 3-antenna), reference antenna, equivalent capacitance
    substitution, standard transmitting loop, standard antenna, and standard held
    methods.
