abstract:
- content: In this IEEE standard the coordination of design, material supply, installation,
    and test procedures required for the connection of a gas-insulated substation
    (GIS) is described. Preferred dimensions for mechanical and electrical interchangeability
    for voltage classes of 69kV and above are established.
