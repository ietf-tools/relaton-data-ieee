abstract:
- content: 'This recommended practice describes the test indicators (including the
    definition and description of the indicators, the explanation of the formula),
    requirements (the range of the test results) and methods (test environment, and
    the test steps for each indicator) of the 6DoF active infrared optics AR/VR handheld-controller
    space tracking technology. Based on the product usage 4 scenarios of the AR/VR
    handheld-controller, the test indicators are mainly divided into three categories:
    dynamic scene test, static scene test, and extreme scene test, including: 1. Dynamic
    scene test, simulating the actual user''s handheld-controller interaction scene,
    the corresponding tests include: absolute position/rotation error, translation/rotation
    resolution, tracking system latency, tracking range 2. Static scene test, testing
    the space tracking performance of the handheld-controller when it is stationary,
    the corresponding tests include: static position jitter and angle drift, maximum
    translation jitter, and pose sampling frequency 3. Extreme scene test, corresponding
    to the handheld-controller space tracking capability in extreme scenes, the corresponding
    tests include: maximum ambient light intensity, minimum number of cameras, time-delay
    of tracking lost/recover'
