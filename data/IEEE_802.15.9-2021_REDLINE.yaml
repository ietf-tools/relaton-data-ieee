abstract:
- content: A message exchange framework based on information elements as a transport
    method for key management protocol (KMP) datagrams and guidelines for the use
    of some existing KMPs with IEEE Std 802.15.4&#8482; is defined in this standard.
    A new KMP is not created in this standard. In support of KMP transmission and
    reception, a generic multiplexed data service layer that can be used to transmit
    large packets from the upper KMP to another peer and that provides for protocol
    discrimination is also provided in this standard. The multiplexed data service
    provides a fragmentation and multiplexing layer for those packets so they can
    be delivered over smaller MAC layer frames and multiplexed on the recipient end
    to the right processing service. The multiplexing provides for EtherType protocol
    discrimination. (The PDF of this standard is available at no cost compliments
    of the IEEE GET program https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page)
