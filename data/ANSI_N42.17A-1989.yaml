abstract:
- content: Minimum acceptable performance criteria for health physics instrumentation
    for use in ionizing radiation fields are established. Included are testing methods
    to establish the acceptability of each type of instrumentation. This standard
    does not specify which instruments or systems are required, nor does it consider
    the number of specific applications of such instruments.
