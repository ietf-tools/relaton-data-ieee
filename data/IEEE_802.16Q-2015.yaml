abstract:
- content: MAC/PHY protocol enhancements for cooperation among base stations in multi-tier
    networks to enhance interference mitigation, mobility management, and base station
    power management are specified in this amendment. Enhanced base stations shall
    support legacy mobile stations. PHY changes to any mobile stations are out of
    scope. In addition, these protocol enhancements include management messaging between
    base stations, and between base stations and mobile stations.
