abstract:
- content: Possible adverse impacts to an operating overhead transmission line which
    might occur whenoperating the line at high temperatures are discussed. Specifically,
    the transmission lines conductor, connectors, and attached accessories in terms
    of degradation in mechanical properties due to annealing elastic and in-elastic
    elongation, and accelerated aging are explored along with limited mitigation recommendations.
    Additionally, predictor equations for accelerated creep and conductor loss of
    strength are detailed in annexes with limited example calculations.
