abstract:
- content: This standard provides a common basis for members of the IEEE 1451 family
    of standards to be interoperable. It defines the functions that are to be performed
    by a transducer interface module (TIM) and the common characteristics for all
    devices that implement the TIM. It specifies the formats for Transducer Electronic
    Data Sheets (TEDS). It defines a set of commands to facilitate the setup and control
    of the TIM as well as reading and writing the data used by the system. Application
    programming interfaces (APIs) are defined to facilitate communications with the
    TIM and with applications.
