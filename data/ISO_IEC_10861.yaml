abstract:
- content: The operation, functions, and attributes of a parallel system bus (PSB),
    called MULTIBUS II, are defined. A high-performance backplane bus intended for
    use in multiple processor systems, the PSB incorporates synchronous, 32-bit multiplexed
    address/data, with error detection, and uses a 10 MHz bus clock. This design is
    intended to provide reliable state-of-the-art operation and to allow the implementation
    of cost-effective, high-performance VLSI for the bus interface. Memory, I/O, message,
    and geographic address spaces are defined. Error detection and retry are provided
    for messages. The message-passing design allows a VLSI implementation, so that
    virtually all modules on the bus will utilize the bus at its highest performance--32
    to 40 Mbyte/s. An overview of PSB, signal descriptions, the PSB protocol, electrical
    characteristics, and mechanical specifications are covered.
