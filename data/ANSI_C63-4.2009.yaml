abstract:
- content: U.S. consensus standard methods, instrumentation, and facilities for measurement
    of radio-frequency (RF) signals and noise emitted from electrical and electronic
    devices in the frequency range 9 kHz to 40 GHz are specified. This standard does
    not include generic nor product-specific emission limits. Where possible, the
    specifications herein are harmonized with other national and international standards
    used for similar purposes.
