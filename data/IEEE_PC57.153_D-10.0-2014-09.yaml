abstract:
- content: 'This paralleling guide describes and compares control methods of paralleling
    regulating transformers. The control methods include: master/follower, circulating
    current, power factor, circulating reactive current and negative reactant methods.
    This guide presents operating philosophy descriptions, sample wiring diagrams,
    typical operational variations, the provision of adequate backup protection and
    typical misapplication consequences. This guide does not apply to phase shifting
    regulating transformers.'
