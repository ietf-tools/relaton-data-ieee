abstract:
- content: Methods of describing random instabilities of importance to frequency and
    time metrology are covered. Quantities covered include frequency, amplitude, and
    phase instabilities; spectral densities of frequency, amplitude, and phase fluctuations;
    and time-domain deviations of frequency fluctuations. In addition, recommendations
    are made for the reporting of measurements of frequency, amplitude, and phase
    instabilities, especially in regard to the recording of experimental parameters,
    experimental conditions, and calculation techniques.
