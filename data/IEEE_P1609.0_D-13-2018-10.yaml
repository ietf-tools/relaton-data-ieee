abstract:
- content: The wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) architecture and services
    necessary for WAVE devices to communicate in a mobile vehicular environment are
    described in this guide. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the family
    of IEEE 1609 standards as of its publication date. These include IEEE Std 1609.2(TM),
    IEEE Standard Security Services for Applications and Management Messages; IEEE
    Std 1609.3(TM), Networking Services; IEEE Std 1609.4(TM), Multi- Channel Operation;
    IEEE Std 1609.11(TM), Over-the-Air Electronic Payment Data Exchange Protocol for
    Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS); IEEE Std 1609.12(TM), Identifiers; and
    IEEE Std 802.11(TM) in operation outside the context of a basic service set.
