abstract:
- content: Requirements and testing methods for a facial recognition testing system
    for end user devices are discussed in this standard. System and security requirements,
    algorithm testing, testing methods, and criteria-level definitions are defined.
    Key metrics for quantized performance evaluation indexes including false accept
    rate (FAR), false reject rate (FRR), attack presentation false acceptance (APFAR),
    and bona fide presentation false rejection rate (BFPFRR) are also defined. Criteria
    levels for testing the performance indexes are specified, including the detailed
    steps, environment, and minimum requirements.
