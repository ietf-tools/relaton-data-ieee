abstract:
- content: Superseded by 484-2002. Recommended design practices and procedures for
    storage, location, mounting, ventilation, instrumentation, preassembly, assembly,
    and charging of vented lead-acid batteries are provided. Required safety practices
    are also included. These recommended practices are applicable to all stationary
    applications. However, specific applications, such as emergency lighting units
    and semiportable equipment, and alternate energy applications, may have other
    appropriate practices and are beyond the scope of this recommended practice.
