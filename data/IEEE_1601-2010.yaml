abstract:
- content: The performance of optical current and voltage measurement systems used
    in the generation, transmission, and distribution of alternating current electricity,
    and to assist in the proper selection of such equipment is described in this trial-use
    standard. This standard covers certain physical characteristics of the sensing
    systems that use optical techniques to measure current and voltage. This standard
    provides the requirements for the performance characteristics and the test of
    optical current and voltage sensors of a nominal system voltage of 1 kV and above,
    the information related to the nature of these sensors, and the information related
    to the application and use of these sensors.
