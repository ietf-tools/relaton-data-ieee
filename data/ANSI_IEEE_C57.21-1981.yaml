abstract:
- content: Superseded by C57.21-1990. All oil-immersed or dry-type, single-phase or
    three-phase, outdoor or indoor shunt reactors rated over 500 kVA are covered.
    Terminology and general requirements are stated, and the basis for rating shunt
    reactors is set forth. Routine, design, and other tests are described, and methods
    for performing them are given. Losses and impedance, temperature rise, dielectric
    tests, and insulation levels are covered. Construction requirements for oil-immersed
    reactors and construction and installation requirements for drytype reactors are
    presented.
