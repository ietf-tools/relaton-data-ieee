abstract:
- content: The required elements for developing, implementing, and administering effective
    electromagnetic energy (EME) safety programs (SPs) to achieve compliance with
    applicable human exposure limits are specified. Concomitant EME hazards, such
    as those caused by interference to medical devices, ignition of flammable atmospheres,
    and detonation of explosive devices, are also addressed. Well-established safety
    processes are used to manage potential EME hazards from known EME sources in the
    0 Hz to 300 GHz frequency range. SP elements for identifying EME hazard locations,
    implementing needed controls, and training personnel, are included. Additional
    descriptions and examples of the SP elements and various factors that can be helpful
    when assessing potential hazards and creating SPs are annexed.
