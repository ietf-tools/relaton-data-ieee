abstract:
- content: 'Many alternating-current rotating electric machines are designed to have
    multiturn form-wound stator coils. In these cases, the winding has two separate
    but interrelated insulating barriers: one (turn insulation) between the various
    turns and the second (ground insulation) between the turns and ground. Failure
    of either of these barriers will prematurely terminate the service life of the
    machine. A test level, twice rated voltage plus 1 kV, for the ground insulation
    has been in existence for many years. This guide suggests methods and test levels
    for the turn insulation.'
