abstract:
- content: Over the past few years, the IEEE 1588&#8482; Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
    standard has been adopted by the telecommunications industry as a preferred solution
    for synchronizing mobile networks. A key challenge is ensuring that PTP equipment
    from different manufacturers will operate properly in a mobile network. This paper
    presents the scope and objectives of the IEEE 1588 Telecommunications Certification
    Program, launched by the IEEE SA Conformity Assessment Program (ICAP) to meet
    this challenge.
