abstract:
- content: The Standard for Industrial Hard Real-Time Communication is an adoption
    of the EPSG DS 301--Ethernet POWERLINK--Communication Profile Specification. Ethernet
    POWERLINK is a communication profile for Real-Time Ethernet (RTE). It extends
    Ethernet according to the IEEE Std 802.3 with mechanisms to transfer data with
    predictable timing and precise synchronisation. The communication profile meets
    timing demands typical for high performance automation and motion applications.
    It does not change basic principles of the Fast Ethernet Standard IEEE 802.3 but
    extends it towards RTE. Thus it is possible to leverage and continue to use any
    standard Ethernet silicon, infrastructure component or test and measurement equipment
    like a network analyzer.
