abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of communication
    between personal telehealth pulse oximetry devices and compute engines (e.g. cell
    phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner
    that enables plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions
    of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models,
    application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies the use of
    specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting
    optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This standard defines
    a common core of communication functionality for personal telehealth pulse oximeters.
