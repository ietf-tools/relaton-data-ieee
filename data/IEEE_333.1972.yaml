abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide guidelines for
    the proper application of electrical equipment to packaging machinery which will
    promote: (1) Safety to personnel and equipment, including the reduction of fire
    and accident hazard (2) Uninterrupted production (3) Long life and low maintenance
    cost This is a minimum recommended practice and is not intended to limit or inhibit
    advancement in the areas of electrical or mechanical engineering. This recommended
    practice covers the application of electrical equipment and wiring furnished as
    part of a packaging machine, and associated equipment commencing at the place
    of connection of the power supply. It shall apply to electrical equipment for
    use on circuits which operate from a supply voltage of 600 V or less. It shall
    not be considered adequate for machines intended for use in locations designated
    as hazardous by the NEC (National Electric Code), NFPA 70-1971 (ANSI C1-1971).'
