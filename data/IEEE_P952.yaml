abstract:
- content: Part I (clauses 3 through 8) of this standard is a specification format
    guide for the preparation of a single-axis interferometric fiber optic gyro (IFOG)
    specification. Part II (clauses 9 through 12) is a compilation of recommended
    procedures for testing an IFOG. These procedures, including test conditions to
    be considered, are derived from those currently in use.For a specific application,
    the test procedure should reflect the requirements of the specification;therefore,
    not all tests outlined in this standard need be included, nor are additional testsprecluded.
