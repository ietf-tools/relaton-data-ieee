abstract:
- content: Superseded by 1101.1-1998 (SH/SS94691) The basic dimensions of a range
    of modular subracks conforming to IEC 60297-3 (1984-01) and IEC 60297-4 (1995-03)
    for mounting in equipment according to IEC 60297-1 (1986-09) andANSI/EIA 310-D-1992,
    together with the basic dimensions of a compatible range of plug-in units,printed
    boards, and backplanes, are covered. The dimensions and tolerances necessary to
    ensuremechanical function compatibility are provided. This standard offers total
    system integration guide-lines with attendant advantages, such as reduction in
    design and development time, manufacturingcost savings, and distinct marketing
    advantages.
