abstract:
- content: This standard defines a modular framework for a Robotically Assisted Surgical
    System (RASS). The framework describes the hierarchical architecture, and presents
    the principles and specifications of the function module division and integration.
    A RASS is mainly divided into an execution module (EM), perception module (PM),
    human-machine interface module (HMI), image navigation/guidance module (ING),
    planning and decision-making (PDM), safety and security module (SSM), and other
    modules.
