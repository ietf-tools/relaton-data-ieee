abstract:
- content: Technical background and application details to support understanding of
    IEEE Std 1547&#8482;- 2018 are provided. The guide facilitates the use of IEEE
    Std 1547-2018 by characterizing various forms of distributed energy resource (DER)
    technologies and their associated interconnection issues. It provides background
    and rationale of the technical requirements of IEEE Std 1547-2018. It also provides
    tips, techniques, and common practices to address issues related to DER project
    implementation. This guide is intended for use by engineers, engineering consultants,
    and knowledgeable individuals in the field of DERs. The IEEE 1547 series of standards
    is cited in the Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, and this guide is one document
    in the IEEE 1547 series.
