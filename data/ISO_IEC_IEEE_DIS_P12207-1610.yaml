abstract:
- content: This International Standard establishes a common process framework for
    describing the full lifecycle of software products (including software elements
    of systems) from conception through retirement. It applies to the acquisition
    or development of software products and services whether performed internally
    or externally to an organization. Those aspects of system definition needed to
    provide the context for software products and services are included. The standard
    also supports the definition, control, assessment and improvement of these processes.
    These processes can be applied concurrently, iteratively, and recursively to a
    system and its elements throughout the life cycle of a system. Users of the standard
    can apply the processes and terminology to construct a suitable life cycle model,
    composed of stages that use processes selected from the standard. ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 (systems life cycle processes) and this IS are fully aligned so that one
    may select appropriate processes from both standards for use in systems with substantial
    software content.
