abstract:
- content: Basic factors and general considerations in selecting the class and means
    of neutral grounding for electrical generating plant auxiliary power systems are
    given in this guide. Apparatus to be used to achieve the desired grounding are
    suggested, and methods to specify the grounding devices are given. Sensitivity
    and selectivity of equipment ground-fault protection as affected by selection
    of the neutral grounding device are discussed, with examples.
