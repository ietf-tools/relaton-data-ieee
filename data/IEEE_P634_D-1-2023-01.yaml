abstract:
- content: The details described in this standard involve developing data to determine
    a fire stop’s resistance to fire and/or any external force imposed through a hose
    stream or water spray. The topics are applicable to fire stops of various materials
    and construction including cable-penetration fire stops which are intended for
    use in fire-resistive barriers. Tests conducted in conformance with the specifications
    listed in this standard will record the performance of fire stops during test
    exposure.
