abstract:
- content: The neutral grounding of single- and three-phase ac electric utility primary
    distribution systems with nominal voltages in the range of 2.4--34.5 kV is addressed.
    Classes of distribution systems grounding are defined. Basic considerations in
    distribution system grounding--concerning economics, control of temporary overvoltages,
    control of ground-fault currents, and ground relaying--are addressed. Also considered
    are use of grounding transformers, grounding of high-voltage neutral of wye/delta
    distribution transformers, and interconnection of primary and secondary neutrals
    of distribution transformers.
