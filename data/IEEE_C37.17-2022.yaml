abstract:
- content: This standard pertains to the requirements for current and voltage protective
    functions of 1) direct-acting overcurrent electromechanical trip devices, 2) direct-acting
    overcurrent electronic trip systems, 3) reverse-current trip systems, and 4) undervoltage
    trip devices that are integral with low-voltage ac (1000 V and below) and general-purpose
    low-voltage dc (1500 V and below) power circuit breakers covered by IEEE Std C37.13
    and IEEE Std C37.14. Additional information, communication, and/or additional
    internal or external protective functions or devices are not covered by this standard.
    This standard should not be interpreted to restrict the inclusion of such functionality
    in the device.
