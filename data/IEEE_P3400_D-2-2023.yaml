abstract:
- content: This standard provides requirements and recommendations for technical terminology
    and communications using the English language that are inclusive. These requirements
    apply to technical information in communications, such as standards, policies,
    plans, procedures, reports, specifications; machine-readable languages, and text
    presented electronically. The standard includes requirements for the processes
    of identifying and replacing non-inclusive (deprecated) language. It identifies
    deprecated terminology and recommends standard and acceptable replacements.
