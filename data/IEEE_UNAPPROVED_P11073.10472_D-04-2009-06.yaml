abstract:
- content: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device
    communication, this standard establishes a normative definition of the communication
    between medication monitoring devices and managers (e.g. cell phones, personal
    computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes) in a manner that enables
    plug-and-play interoperability. It leverages appropriate portions of existing
    standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology and information models. It specifies
    the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments
    restricting ambiguity in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This standard
    defines a common core of communication functionality for medication monitors.
    In this context, medication monitors are defined as devices that have the ability
    to determine and communicate (to a manager) measures of a user's adherence to
    a medication regime.
