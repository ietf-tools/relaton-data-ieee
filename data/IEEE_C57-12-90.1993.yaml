abstract:
- content: 'Replaced by IEEE Std C57.12.90-1999 (SH/SS94778) Abstract: Methods for
    performing tests specified in IEEE Std C57.12.00-1993, IEEE Standard General Requirements
    for Liquid-Immersed Distribution, Power, and Regulating Transformers, and other
    standards applicable to liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers
    are described. Instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators,
    arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding
    transformers, and mine transformers are excluded. This standard covers resistance
    measurement, polarity and phase-relation tests, ratio tests, no-load-loss and
    excitation current measurements, impedance and loadloss measurements, dielectric
    tests, temperature tests, short-circuit tests, and audible-sound-level measurements.'
