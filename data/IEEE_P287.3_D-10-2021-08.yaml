abstract:
- content: The IEEE P287 series of documents presents the combined efforts of IEEE
    P287 Working Group that reflect the knowledge and experience of leading specialists
    in the development and measurement of precision coaxial connectors for RF, microwave
    and millimeter-wave frequencies. It presents minimum performance requirements
    to standardize both hermaphroditic and pin- and socket-type connectors (287.1).
    It provides recommended electrical and mechanical test procedures for Instrument
    Grade and Metrology Grade precision connectors (287.2). Recommended reference
    procedures including connector effects, connector care and cleaning, connector
    repeatability and reproducibility test procedures, and a color code for connectors
    are detailed in the third part of the standard (287.3), this document. A bibliography
    provides a list of pertinent references for measurement techniques used in determining
    electrical, mechanical, and dimensional parameters for coaxial connectors.
