abstract:
- content: The P287 series of documents presents the combined efforts of IEEE P287
    Working Group that reflect the knowledge and experience of leading specialists
    in the development and measurement of precision coaxial connectors for RF, microwave,
    and millimeter-wave frequencies. It presents minimum performance requirements
    to standardize both hermaphroditic and pin-and socket- type connectors (IEEE Std
    287.1). It provides a recommended practice for electrical and mechanical test
    procedures for Instrument Grade and Metrology Grade precision connectors (IEEE
    Std 287.2, this document). Recommended reference procedures including connector
    effects, connector care and cleaning, connector repeatability and reproducibility
    test procedures, and a color code for connectors are detailed in the third part
    of the standard (IEEE Std 287.3). The bibliography provides a list of pertinent
    references for measurement techniques used in determining electrical, mechanical,
    and dimensional parameters for coaxial connectors.
