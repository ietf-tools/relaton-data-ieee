abstract:
- content: This standard describes heterogeneous networks convergence and scalability,
    specifies the requirements of network convergence, extends the system architecture
    defined in IEEE Std 1888(TM), IEEE Standard for Ubiquitous Green Community Control
    Network Protocol, with two new IEEE 1888(TM) Components, i.e., the reconfigurable
    resolution server (RRS) and the intelligent application resolver (IAR), and generalizes
    primitive data type expressions and explicit field-bus data type management in
    IEEE 1888 systems. This standard enables IEEE 1888 systems to interoperate with
    heterogeneous access networks efficiently and improves the efficiency, flexibility,
    scalability and manageability of IEEE 1888 systems.
