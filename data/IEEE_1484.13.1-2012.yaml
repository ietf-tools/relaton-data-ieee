abstract:
- content: A conceptual model for interpreting externalized representations of digital
    aggregations of resources for learning, education, and training is defined. The
    conceptual model is defined as an ontology. Internal compositions and uses of
    digital resources are not specified nor are processing methods for resource aggregations.
