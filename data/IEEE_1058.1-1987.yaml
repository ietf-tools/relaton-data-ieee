abstract:
- content: Revised as IEEE Std 1058-1998. The format and content of software project
    management plans are prescribed. By software project plan is meant the controlling
    document that defines the technical and managerial processes necessary to satisfy
    the project requirements. The requirements are applicable to all types of software
    projects and to software products of any size, complexity, or criticality at any
    point in the life cycle. All forms of product delivery media, including firmware,
    embedded systems code, programmable logic arrays, and software-in-silicon are
    included.
