abstract:
- content: General recommendations for the selection of methods and equipment found
    to be effective and practical for grounding during the stringing of overhead trasmission
    line conductors and overhead ground wires are provided. The guide is directed
    to transmission voltages only. The aim is to present in one document sufficient
    details of present day grounding practices and equipment used in effective grounding
    and to provide electrical theory and considerations necessary to safeguard personnel
    during the stringing operations of transmission lines.
