abstract:
- content: The functional, electrical, optical, and mechanical characteristics of
    a fibre optic interface for connecting a 4- or 16-Mbit/s token ring station to
    the trunk coupling unit of a token ring are specified. This technical report is
    based upon a fibre optic transmitter, a channel of multimode graded-index fibres,
    and a direct-detection photodiode receiver; and includes signaling provisions
    for bypass of the station from the ring and self-test capabilities.
