abstract:
- content: large collection of peer-reviewed IEEE and other industry standards and
    guidelines related to overhead transmission line design, testing, construction,
    and maintenance is summarized in this recommended practice. This includes aspects
    such as structures, foundations, conductors, insulators, hardware, and electrical
    effects. It identifies the documents in an organized and comprehensive fashion
    along with explanations of the material presented within each document and when
    a particular document should be considered.
