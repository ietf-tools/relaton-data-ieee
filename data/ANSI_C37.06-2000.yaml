abstract:
- content: This standard is a revision of ANSI C37.06-1997. It reflects small editorial
    changes needed to coordinate with the final wording contained in the defining
    standards ANSI/IEEE C37.04-1999 and ANSI/IEEE C37.09-1999. Some ratings have also
    been updated. Because this revision is primarily editorial in nature, this Foreword
    describes the substantive and editorial changes between this revision and the
    1987 version.The format of the tables remains very much the same, except that
    some ratings, which had been given in the notes (sometimes on a different page
    from the table of preferred ratings), have been listed explicitly in the tables.
