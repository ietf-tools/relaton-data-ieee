abstract:
- content: Microgrid deployment requires a microgrid control system and a microgrid
    protection system. The design of both systems needs to consider the nature of
    the microgrid assets, which may include a significant amount of distributed energy
    resources, and the modes of operation, either grid-connected or islanded modes.
    This guide covers the design and selection of protective devices and the coordination
    between them for the different modes of operation of the microgrid. It proposes
    different approaches to detect and take proper actions and dependably and securely
    protect the microgrid and its equipment.
