abstract:
- content: Establishes minimum functional design criteria for the power, instrumentation,
    and control portions of nuclear power generating station safety systems. The criteria
    are to be applied to those systems required to protect the public health and safety
    by functioning to mitigate the consequences of design basis events. The intent
    is to promote safe practices for design and evaluation of safety system performance
    and reliability. Although the standard is limited to safety systems, many of the
    principles may have applicability to equipment provided for safe shutdown, post-accident
    monitoring display instrumentation, preventive interlock features, or any other
    systems, structures, or equipment related to safety.
