abstract:
- content: Superseded by 576-2000. A guide to installation, splicing, termination,
    and field-proof testing of cable systems is provided. The aim is to avoid premature
    cable failure due to improper installation and mechanical damage during installation,
    and to provide a reference that can be specified for cable installations. This
    standard is not intended to be a design document; many of the problems of installation
    can be avoided by designing cable layouts with the installation limits of this
    recommended practice.
