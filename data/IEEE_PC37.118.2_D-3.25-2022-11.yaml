abstract:
- content: A method for real-time exchange of synchronized phasor measurement data
    between power system equipment is defined. This standard specifies messaging that
    can be used with any suitable communication protocol for real-time communication
    between phasor measurement units (PMU), phasor data concentrators (PDC), and other
    applications. It defines message types, contents, and use. Data types and formats
    are specified. A typical measurement system is described. Communication options
    and requirements are described. Cybersecurity is discussed, and while its importance
    is acknowledged in the overall system, it is beyond the scope of this standard.
