abstract:
- content: The primary purpose of this Guide is to present and discuss the applicability
    and limitations of the various measurement methods now in use, or available, for
    testing the electrical insulation of power apparatus in the field. The purpose
    of this Guide is also to consider the special conditions encountered in field
    testing, and their effect on instruments, methods and procedures for making tests
    on the electrical insulation of power apparatus.
