abstract:
- content: 'This document provides general guidelines on the preparation of a functional
    specification for a solid-state electronic shunt device used to compensate voltage
    fluctuation. The guide covers devices rated to Medium Voltage (1kV&#8211;35kV).
    The device contains in general: an inverter, rectifier or DC converter, energy
    storage device, and coupling transformer. The device typically is connected in
    parallel with the network using a coupling transformer.'
